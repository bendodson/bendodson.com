	<article>
		<p>I've been making iPhone apps since the introduction of the App Store in July 2008. I have built a number of my own apps (which have been featured by Apple amongst others) and I have built apps for a hugely varied client base; everyone from worldwide brands to one-man businesses. I have consulted on iPad magazines, built top 10 ranking apps (including some that have reached #1 in the App Store), and been featured on national television. In addition, I have also developed my own apps which have become businesses in their own right and then successfully had them acquired. If you need an iOS developer, then I'm probably what you're looking for.</p>

		<p>I've recently been working on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A new social network iPhone app fronted by a household name (launching early 2016).</li>
			<li>A native watchOS app for a major existing health app.</li>
			<li>A tvOS app for a streaming music company keen to expand to Apple TV.</li>
			<li>An iPhone app aimed at the childcare industry (launching January 2016).</li>
			<li>Working with MFI Game Controllers and a Parrot Bebop Drone to make flight more precise.</li>
			<li>Working with previous clients on adding new iOS 8 and iOS 9 features such as sharing and keyboard extensions, Touch ID integration, search integration, and support for 3D Touch.</li>
			<li>An HTML 5 prototype of an iPad game featuring some of the biggest names in Formula One. (<strong>update:</strong> I was later commissioned to build the native iPad version which is now in use within the company to great acclaim - future versions are planned)</li>
			<li>An iPad app for sales reps at a medical company. The app displayed various widgets (video, slideshows, interactive charts, etc) that were populated via a PHP based backend which I also designed and built.</li>
			<li>Optimising several apps for the new technologies and design language of iOS 7, iOS 8, and iOS 9.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The majority of my work has been in Objective-C but I exclusively use Swift 2.0 at present. I never write apps using HTML wrappers; it's a poor user experience. I also only write apps for iOS and tvOS; I do not work on Android or Windows Phone projects.</p>

		<p>Many of the iOS projects I've worked on for clients over the past few years are on internal systems whilst others are subject to Non-Disclosure Agreements. However, I have compiled a small selection of some of the bigger projects I've been involved with below.</p>

			<h3>WallaBee</h3>
			<p>The ultimate location-based item game</p>
		</header>
		<p>WallaBee is the ultimate collectibles game for your iPhone. The aim of the game is to complete sets by collecting beautiful digital items in a variety of ways including foraging at any of over 2 million real world locations. Each item and set is uniquely numbered so you'll need to be quick if you want to beat your friends to the lowest numbers!</p>
		<p>This app was a culmination of 3 years of research complete with Game Center integration, In App Purchasing, and 3 full developer APIs. It was recently named the '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCo50ory5Gc&amp;feature=player_embedded">Best European Startup of 2012</a>' and has been featured in numerous articles both in print and online.</p>
		<p>I built both the app and the PHP-based API that powered it as well as acting as CEO and support team for what was a huge community of players in over 90 countries. After growing the game successfully over 3.5 years, I sold it to <a href="http://munzee.com/">Munzee</a> in September 2015. I remain a shareholder and have an input on the future growth of the game.</p>

			<h3>Chipp'd</h3>
			<p>Share secrets via unique QR code based gifts</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked on <a href="http://chippd.com/">Chipp'd</a> towards the end of 2015 in order to build them a version 2.0 of their app within a very agressive timescale. Chipp'd is an app that works with real world products (available at <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d">John Lewis</a>) to let you share secrets or private messages with your friends. You simply scan the QR code on the gift, create your secret (with video, audio, photos, and text), and send the gift; your friend will then be able to see that secret when they scan it with the app or any other QR scanner. It is also possible to share secrets for free using the app via auto-generated URLs that can be sent via email or SMS.</p>
		<p>I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the CTO of Chipp'd to integrate their existing API into the product. Everything was written in Swift 2.0 and used AutoLayout for flexible layouts on all iPhone screen sizes. I'm particularly proud of the QR scanner which I custom built when it transpired that the products that had been printed and shipped to distributors were too light for a conventional QR scanner to detect; I used GPUImage to manipulate the live video feed with multiple filters per second in order to quickly scan at different brightnesses and solve the problem.</p>

			<h3>Brapp</h3>

		</header>
		<p>Brapp is a free and easy way to create and discover exciting musical collaborations all over the world. Producers can share their beats allowing anyone to make mini music videos right on their phone complete with video filters and custom audio balancing.</p>
		<p>I worked with Brapp throughout 2015 as the sole iOS developer working closely with the app creator and his API developer. I was able to write the app in Swift and use AutoLayout to make sure everything scales beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone. In addition, I made use of GPUImage for the custom video filters and a whole load of low-level audio APIs to get the audio balance just right as well as real time waveforms and switching between external microphones. The design went through a number of iterations, each better than the last, and I was able to use my extensive UX knowledge to help shape the end result.</p>

			<h3>Great British Bee Count</h3>
			<p>Help monitor the British bee population</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://twothirdswater.co.uk">Two Thirds Water</a> during Spring 2015 to build a new version of the Great British Bee Count app for their client <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/page/join-great-british-bee-count-today">Friends of the Earth</a>. I built the app from scratch to make use of the Swift language and quickly use features such as AutoLayout to scale their pixel-perfect designs to the various sizes of iPhone. The app allows you to count bees in your local area - these counts are stored locally so that they can be performed offline with synchornisation happening automatically when a network connection appears.</p>
		<p>The Great British Bee Count is taking place from 1st May until 31st May 2015.</p>

			<h3>LOLy</h3>
			<p>Whimsical, clever, and handmade emoji</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with Loly at the end of 2014 to update their iPhone app to fix performance issues, improve usability, and add an iOS 8 keyboard. The app was written from the ground up with Swift, uses AutoLayout to render beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone, has iCloud syncing of favourites, and includes an incredibly technically complex iOS 8 keyboard extension. In addition, I built an online admin system so that the packs could be updated, added, and re-ordered remotely without going through the App Store review process. This is all powered by an innovative patch system I developed which allows for small delta updates to minimise bandwidth costs.</p>
		<p>You can learn more about the app build on <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/03/25/loly-v2/">my blog</a>.</p>

			<h3>Channel 4 Horse Tracker</h3>
			<p>Live time-synced horse tracking for the John Smith's Grand National</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://monterosa.co.uk/">Monterosa Productions</a> in spring 2013 as the sole iOS developer to produce the Horse Tracker app for Channel 4. The app uses some innovative technology in order to provide a groundbreaking second screen experience on iPhone and iPad. Each horse within the 3 days of racing at Aintree is fitted with a tracker in order to provide their exact position within their race along with speed and distance data. This is displayed in the app to help you find your horse but the really clever piece is that the app listens to the TV broadcast in order to timesync you perfectly - this is important as the terrestrial broadcast can have up to a 20 second difference depending on where in the country you are and what service you use.</p>
		<p>The app was highly successful with 165,000 unique users during the Grand National whilst reaching #1 on the App Store. I am currently working on further additions to enable the app to be used in other horse races throughout 2013.</p>

			<h3>Glenfiddich Residence Changhi</h3>
			<p>A display stand app that controls audio, video, and a weather chamber</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.verb.digital">Verb Digital</a> in spring 2015 as the sole iOS developer to develop a unique app for Glenfiddich. The app is part of a large installation to showcase a limited edition of Glenfiddich which is available exclusively at Changhi Airport. The single cask that has been selected by Glenfiddich is on display within a specially constructed glass chamber that showcases the weather and atmospheric conditions of the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. The iPad app allows for customers to see the current conditions in Dufftown including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and the time. This is paired with multiple sound effects which match with the weather conditions. The app also talks with a control PC via a direct socket connection over WiFi in order to control the weather effects within the chamber simulating morning fog, wind, and even rain!</p>
		<p>The app is written entirely in Swift 1.2 and the iPad is locked down with Guided Access to prevent customers accessing anything else. You can see the app at the Glenfiddich Residence store in Changhi Airport for the duration of 2015.</p>

			<h3>IslandBreak</h3>
			<p>A smart travel guide for The Bahamas</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with the founder of IslandBreak during Spring 2014 as their only developer. The app was interesting to work on due to the need for a completely offline experience. This wasn’t limited to just the points of interest and itineraries (which feature a huge amount of beautiful high-resolution photos) but also the map; this was a requirement so that tourists don’t have to use their data plans, particularly in an area which has very poor mobile reception. Getting a full map of the islands complete with multiple zoom levels and the experience you expect on iOS was difficult, but works really well. In addition, I built an online CMS in PHP so that the app content can be updated remotely without going through the App Store approval process.</p>

			<h3>Meat Map London</h3>
			<p>The insiders guide to the best butchers, street stalls and meat restaurants in the capital</p>
		</header>
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://thelatenightsalon.co.uk/">The Late Night Salon</a> in autumn 2013 as the only iOS and PHP developer to produce the Meat Map London app. The app allows customers to find interesting 'meateries' in London and displays lots of metadata such as contact numbers, opening hours, and rich imagery. In addition to the application (which makes use to iCloud for syncing favorites), I built the online CMS and API which powers the app and allows for fast delta updates when new content is added by the production team.</p>
		<p>The app was designed for iOS 7 but has been retro-fitted so that it can also run on iOS 6 with a similar design. There is iCloud syncing functionality, use of UIDynamics, and integration with the built-in Facebook and Twitter services.</p>

			<h3>Blind Bags</h3>

		<p>Blind Bags is a simple prototype I built in order to manage my various blind bag collections (including Disney Infinity Power Discs and LEGO Minifigures). The app is entirely built in Swift 1.2 and uses <a href="http://parse.com/">Parse</a> for data storage and syncing. This also ties into an <a href="http://blindba.gs/users/bendodson/">online page</a> which lists my collection along with the items I need and the spares I have available - this was built using the Parse PHP SDK.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.portalentertainment.co.uk">Portal Entertainment</a> throughout the first half of 2013 to build the original prototypes and game elements for their unique horror experience. This included using the camera and timezone detection in order to determine the darkness of a room, interactive glyph recognition from touch gestures, AI for a self writing journal, and advanced video rendering techniques to overlay dynamic content and display the players home within the experience. In addition, I wrote several APIs to provide more advanced functionality (such as determing sunrise and sundown at player location) and worked with <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> in order to add real phone numbers that could be called and enabled the game to phone the player. Finally, I built several companion websites that went with the experience.</p>

		<p>I helped push forward a radical redesign of the application whilst also overhauling the PHP backend which powered their website and API. The app makes use of many SDK features including the In-App Purchasing APIs.</p>
		<p>ExpenseMagic has been featured on numerous websites and national newspapers as well as appearing as the #1 Financial app in the UK App Store - It has also been in the top 40 of all free iPhone apps in the UK App Store and is regularly featured in "What's Hot".</p>

		<p>Finding the best places in an area can be difficult. How do you know the best place to eat in a new town or find a really great day out for the family? Introducing Highlights, the crowd sourced recommendation app that lets you find the very best places around the world. Whether you're trying to discover the nicest bar in your town or looking to plan your next vacation, Highlights (a Univeral app for iPhone and iPad) will have you covered with its advanced recommendation engine.</p>
		<p>Highlights uses data from popular check-in services Gowalla and Foursquare and then pushes it through our custom ranking engine to work out the very best places around the world. This isn't just the places near you sorted by most check-ins, but ranked in popularity based on data such as photographs, comments, business listings, user activity, Foursquare tips, Gowalla highlights, and other social network activity.</p>
		<p>Highlights was featured by Apple as '<a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/highlights-app-store.jpg">iPad App of the Week</a>' in September 2011 and featured in the 'Best of 2011 Rewind' on iTunes.</p>

			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>Photo and location based evidence when someone uses your phone</p>
		</header>
		<p>Security! for iPhone 4 is an app designed to capture evidence of other people using your phone. It works by pretending to look like another app or your iPhone homescreen, yet when anyone touches the screen, their photo is taken (using the front-facing camera) and is automatically saved to your iPhoto library or emailed to you within seconds. With our latest update, you can also receive additional information in the alert email including a screenshot showing exactly where the screen was tapped (e.g. were they trying to look at your text messages or did they just want to play Angry Birds?)</p>
		<p>By using the background task completion APIs present in iOS 4, a photo capture can be triggered when the user presses the home button so even if somebody tries to quit the app, it will still successfully photograph them and send you the details.</p>
		<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've removed this app from the App Store due to some incompatabilities with iOS 5 and improvements to the iCloud system that make finding a lost iPhone easier than ever. I'm working on a new version that is optimised for iOS 8 that should be available as a free update in Spring 2015.</p>

		<p>There is also the ability to add multiple Gowalla accounts allowing you to check into several places at once for extra data savings - this is particularly useful if you are travelling with friends and all want to check in at the same time. An advanced search system that allows you to narrow spots down by specific categories, keywords, bookmarks, popular, featured, or a combination! Finally, a built-in item finder will show you the location of any items that you don't have vaulted.</p>

		<p>The Magnetic Flux &amp; Metal Detector was one of the first iPhone apps I built and demonstrates how you can use a compass in an iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 to detect metal and magnetic flux. Once you've enabled Location Services, you can start detecting metal. A scale (similar to a real metal detector) is played depending on the amount of metal detected and the phone will vibrate if it receives more than an 80% reading.</p>

		<p>As demonstrated in the video above, by employing some magnets, you can turn the app into a theramin thanks to the musical scale included. First person to play the Doctor Who theme successfully wins!</p>

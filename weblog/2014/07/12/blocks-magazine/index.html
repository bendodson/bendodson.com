			<p>I&#39;m very excited to see that <a href="http://www.blocksmag.com">Blocks Magazine</a> sold enough copies to prove it as a concept and is now going to be a monthly publication starting in October:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Blocks magazine is going monthly from autumn 2014. The first issue of this exciting new magazine written by LEGO enthusiasts, for LEGO enthusiasts, is due to hit the shops on Thurs 23rd Oct.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;ve started offering <a href="http://www.blocksmag.com/#!subcribe/c7dd">yearly and 2-yearly subscriptions on their website</a> - an instant purchase for me!</p>

<p>If you are a fan of LEGO and you haven&#39;t picked up the first issue yet, it is well worth getting. It has a lot more content than I was expecting for a pilot magazine (including an excellent review of the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Sandcrawler-75059">Star Wars Sandcrawler</a>) but the proof reading leaves a lot to be desired. Loads of great stuff though so highly recommended.</p>

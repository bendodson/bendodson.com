			<p>Like many people, Yosemite has been a total killer for my WiFi. I finally broke down over the weekend when my WiFI was disconnecting every 10 seconds or so<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. There is now a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2014/11/25/heres-the-root-cause-and-a-workaround-for-ios-8-and-yosemite-wi/">workaround available</a> but it requires losing the ability to AirDrop which I use frequently. I&#39;ve eventually fixed it with a long winded solution which I thought I&#39;d share, but first a little backstory...</p>

<p>My WiFi is completely Apple-centric. I have an Airport Extreme (the newest 802.11ac model) and nothing but Apple computers. There are a couple of Apple TVs in the house and a few Airport Express&#39; for AirPlaying music. A little while ago <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/17/issues-with-airport-express-airport-extreme-and-yosemite/">I detailed how Yosemite was erroneously connecting through an Airport Express</a> causing serious slowdown; the solution I had at that time was to separate my WiFi into 5GHz and 2.4GHz channels (with all AirPlay on 2.4 and all devices on 5). That was the setup.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ve had to revert to doing this for my work computer:</p>

<p><img src="http://playground.bendodson.com/airport-lan-yosemite.jpg" alt="Fixing Yosemite with an Airport Express and USB Ethernet cable"></p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I&#39;ve had to plug in a USB Ethernet adapter and use a LAN cable to an Airport Express operating as a wireless bridge! As far as Yosemite is concerned, that&#39;s a LAN connection and so it doesn&#39;t drop out continuously. Problem solved!</p>

<p>There was one issue though; that Apple USB Ethernet adapter (which they <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MC704ZM/A/apple-usb-ethernet-adapter">still sell</a>) doesn&#39;t work in Mavericks yet alone Yosemite. To fix it, you need to download the drivers for the chip it is built on (helpfully <a href="http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&amp;PItemID=136">available from ASIX</a>), restart Yosemite, then manually add a USB Ethernet connection within Network in System Settings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all working like a charm, complete with full AirDrop support and no dropped connections. My new Retina iMac is coming today<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> so I&#39;m hoping that it having an 802.11ac chip will forgoe the need for this ridiculous workaround. At the very least I&#39;ll be able to leave out the ethernet adapter!</p>

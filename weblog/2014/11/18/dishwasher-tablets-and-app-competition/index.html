			<p>This week I bought some new dishwasher tablets online that happened to be on offer. When they arrived, their packaging had a banner at the top saying <em>‘switch &amp; see the difference’</em> which got me thinking about app competition.</p>

<p>I noticed it today when I loaded the dishwasher after breakfast. Where I usually rinse the plates, I instead put them straight in so I could test if these tablets really were any better. When I unloaded the dishes and found them not as clean as usual, I immediately thought not to buy those tablets again. The strange thing about the above is that it was a totally subconcious decision both to forgo rinsing and to blame the new tablets rather than my change of habit.</p>

<p>This relates to app competition as it shows something which is hardwired in us; <em><strong>a competitor must be much better in order to affect a change</strong></em>. If your app is competing by having the same features or slightly more features, that might not be enough to make your competitors customers switch.</p>

<p>When I look at competitors for <a href="http://wallabeegame.com/">WallaBee</a>, the main one is <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/packrat/">PackRat</a>, a collecting game that runs on Facebook. Whilst we have better artwork and features, it is still a struggle to make people switch as there isn’t necessarily a killer reason for them to make that switch. That’s the task I’m focussing on now. I need to go that extra mile to get players to change to my game; I need to wash their non-rinsed plates.</p>

			<p>For the past few months I’ve been meaning to start a newsletter; partially as a way of motivating me to finish some of my many projects, partially as a way of building up a mailing list so I can market my own apps better. The priority for this has only increased as the long-term future for Twitter (my main source of referrals to my various apps and websites) has moved to shakier ground<sup id="fnref:twitterpessimism" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitterpessimism" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Today I finally took that step by creating <em><a href="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/">The Dodo Developer</a></em><sup id="fnref:dododeveloper" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dododeveloper" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> on Substack.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/embed" width="100%" height="320" style="border:1px solid #EEE; background: white; margin: 0 auto; display: block; border-radius: 16px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>I’ve created an <a href="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/p/1-the-setup">initial introductory post</a> going through some of the motivations for this move and listing some of the items on my “To do” list but the aim is to produce a new issue every 2 weeks.</p>

<p>I like to use my main website for either announcing new releases or providing code-level tutorials; the newsletter will be slightly different in that it will be showcasing things <em>way</em> before they are necessarily ready for prime time. This has two main benefits in that working akin to a 2-week sprint cycle will hopefully motivate me to proceed with the numerous app ideas that are half-finished on my hard drive; on the flip side, it will also hopefully generate some much needed feedback during the development process as I’m planning to invite subscribers to early access betas of new apps and major updates to existing apps. This all begins next week when I’ll be going into detail with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Music Library Tracker</a> upgrade that introduces Spatial Audio matching as well as showing off a new dice-based game mechanic I’ve created for a “Choose your own Adventure” style game.</p>

<p>As we head into 2023 I’m determined to try and spend more of my time on my independent projects. By subscribing to the newsletter, you’ll be directly boosting my motivation towards that aim and hopefully getting an insight into how a developer forms an idea into a digital reality.</p>

<p>I’ll be landing in your inbox for the first issue next week!</p>

      <p>I don’t necessarily share the pessimism of others with regards to Twitter’s future but there is a non-zero chance that it shuts down without warning one night in the near future so best to be prepared. I won’t be moving to any other social media network. <a href="#fnref:twitterpessimism" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>I can’t remember if I’ve mentioned my affinity for dodos on this blog before but the reason for the name comes from two things: my surname contains the same letters as “dodo” and when I was at school I loved the dodo character in Disney’s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (“you there, stop kicking that mackeral”). When I developed my first piece of software, a database system for the management of choral robes (honestly), I used “Dodo Apps” as the name and it’s kind of stuck! <a href="#fnref:dododeveloper" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

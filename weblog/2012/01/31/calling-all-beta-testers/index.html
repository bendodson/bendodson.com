			<p>I’m happy to announce that my biggest app yet is going to be available in mid-February. It’s currently running in a closed beta but I’m now looking to expand the beta testing pool significantly in the run up to launch.</p>

<p>If you have some spare time and would like to help me out (as well as maybe getting some free stuff once it launches) then please fill out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/bendodson.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9vLXluM3RwNnZYNDRGendxWXBfTEE6MQ">beta tester application form</a>. Based on previous betas, I expect interest to be high so I’ve had to implement a cap on how many people I can accept. Please bear in mind that beta testing can take a lot of time (as you’ll be required to feedback on each build that is sent out) so if you don’t have the time please don’t apply as your position could go to somebody else who is available.</p>

<p>If your application is successful, I’ll be in touch by the 3rd of February.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to show you all what I’ve been working on for the past 6 months. More details will be available soon…</p>

			<p>The last time my website got a major upgrade was back on the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/04/26/london-underground-tube-updates-api-is-live/">26th April 2009</a> when I moved from a self-built system to Wordpress (for my blog at least). Since then there have been a few minor design tweaks and a few page changes but the majority has stayed the same.</p>

<p>Today I’ve put live a big update that covers the design, content, and functionality of the site. The main reasons for a change were two-fold; to help me update the site more frequently and to ensure a better reading experience for visitors, regardless of device.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The design changes are actually fairly minimal. I’ve put in a nicer font with more spacing and I’ve removed some unnecessary sidebars to make the site full width - it should be a lot more comfortable to read in a traditional browser. However, the biggest change is the introduction of a mobile stylesheet which still shows the full content of the site but rendered in a much nicer way. Needless to say, this has been optimised for iPhone but it should work on any mobile device.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>Managing the content on my site has always been a bit of a chore from a UX view as it caters to very different audiences. You might want to <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/contract-ios/">hire me</a>, look at <a href="https://bendodson.com/apps/">my apps</a>, play with some of <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/">my projects</a>, or simply <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/">read my blog</a>. You might have come here looking for a <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/browser-extensions/">Firefox extension</a>, to <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/09/airplay-mirroring-tv-out-and-the-apple-tv-as-a-games-console/">read a post about the Apple TV</a>, or because you want to see <a href="https://bendodson.com/work/apps/">my portfolio</a>. Regardless, I’ve done a slight reorganisation so that the main pieces of the site are all readily accessible. This was mainly done by separating <a href="https://bendodson.com/apps/">my apps</a> from <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/">my projects</a> and restructuring the <a href="https://bendodson.com/work/">work section</a>.</p>

<p>As more and more people have come to my site, the number of emails I have to deal with has increased dramatically. I’m always keen to hear from people and so <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2010/11/04/contact-forms/">I had my email addresses displayed loud and proud</a> on my contact page. This hasn’t changed but I have introduced some new pages called “Guidelines” which might help you if your enquiry fits into a particular area. For example, if you’re <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/contract-ios/">contacting me about a contract position</a>, you’ll be able to see my day rate and the projects I enjoy so that you can be sure I’m the right person for the job. Whilst I expect to receive significantly less enquiries, I’m hopeful that those I do receive (particularly for work) are more fruitful for both parties.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/">my blog</a> has been updated so that I can now link to external sites that I find interesting and just add a comment to them (similar to the linked lists on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>). Quite often I see an interesting topic that I’d like to comment on that is too big for Twitter but too small for a full blown blog post. Now that I can link to external stories more easily I should be able to keep the weblog posts more regular.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering about comments, I don’t allow them on my website and I haven’t done for over a year now. Keeping on top of moderation, etc, was providing too much of a hassle and I prefer the one-to-one contact of email or the public sharing of Twitter which ensures that I can actually reply (most people didn’t sign up for email alerts on comments). However, I do frequently update my posts to include any interesting comments people send to me so please do <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">get in touch</a> if you have something to add.</p>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>

<p>This is where the biggest update has come. I’ve long been getting bored with Wordpress and have always found it a bit of a chore to put posts out. Also, the site was quite slow but the various caching plugins I found weren’t quite doing it for me. To that end, the entire site has been replaced with completely static HTML (aside from some of the project pages). I write all my blog posts in Markdown and these are now pushed through <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to be converted to pure HTML. However the coolest bit (for me) is that I’m running a Dropbox instance on my server - this means that whenever I compile the site with Jekyll on one of my macs, all of the generated files are automatically synced to my server and then through a symlink to my web directory. In short, I can post entries more quickly and they will load much faster for you.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you find any problems please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">let me know</a>.</p>

<p><strong>One More Thing</strong> - I almost forgot! <a href="https://github.com/bendodson">All of my code samples and snippets are now available on GitHub</a>.</p>

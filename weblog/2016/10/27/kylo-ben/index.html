			<p>I have three main hobbies; coding, video games, and LEGO. With the first, I’m fortunate to have a flexible job that allows me to code on tons of different and varied projects every day. With the last, I’ve literally run out of space for the models I already have (most of which are over 2000 bricks in size). Video games, then, are really my main hobby. In the last year I’ve <a href="http://connectingtohost.com/">started a podcast on co-operative gaming</a>, built a powerful gaming PC, and spent somewhere in the region of 900 hours playing games. Today I’m happy to announce a new website I’ve been working on dedicated to my gaming hobby; it’s called <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk">Kylo Ben</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/kylo-ben.jpg" width="800" height="400" /></p>

<p>Kylo Ben is divided into several different sections:</p>

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<p>I’m currently varying between reviews, things I’m excited about, and general thought pieces on the industry. So far, I have published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A look ahead at the <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/titanfall-2-achievements">achievements in Titanfall 2</a> (compared to Titanfall)</li>
  <li>A review of minimalistic transport sim, <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/mini-metro-review">Mini Metro</a></li>
  <li>A piece about <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/my-first-steam-refund">my first refund on Steam</a> in 11 years</li>
  <li>Some thoughts on the <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/thoughts-on-the-nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> announcement</li>
  <li>A review of the <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/lego-dimensions-doctor-who">Doctor Who LEGO Dimensions level pack</a></li>
  <li>A roundup of the <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/humble-monthly-october-2016">games in the October Humble Bundle</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m trying to write new pieces every couple of days and it has proven to be a good way to practice my writing and get some long form thoughts out that don’t fit neatly into a 140 character tweet. It also means I can keep these game centric pieces away from my more work-oriented blog here at <a href="https://bendodson.com/">bendodson.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’ve listed a few things about my current gaming setups on my <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/about/">about page</a>. It details the components in my gaming PC, my current console and mobile gaming systems, and a look through the various consoles I’ve owned since I started gaming in 1991.</p>

<h3 id="games">Games</h3>

<p>I have a single page which lists all of the games I currently own on both Steam and my Xbox One. Each game has more details including purchase date, last played, total gaming time, and a short note about where I’m currently at with the game. I also list any articles related to that game for easy reference (and vice versa). For example, here is the entry for <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/games/mini-metro">Mini Metro</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gaming-time">Gaming Time</h3>

<p>This is perhaps my biggest achievement; a complete log of time spent on each game. The page updates daily and will list each game I’ve played over the last 2 months along with duration and a link through to more details. This is done through a combination of two custom scripts I wrote to scrape both my Steam library and Xbox Live / Windows 10 account periodically for changes. It’s been fascinating for me to see exactly how long I’ve spent on certain games (*cough* <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/games/peggle-2">Peggle 2</a> *cough*) and will allow me to easily write a regular piece on games I’ve played over the previous month.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to be writing regularly about my biggest hobby and I’m looking forward to posting frequently for the foreseeable future. I have a few extra things to announce soon including some apps and game mods so <a href="https://twitter.com/bendodson">follow me on Twitter</a> for the latest updates. Alternatively, there is an <a href="http://kyloben.co.uk/rss.xml">RSS feed available</a> for Kylo Ben which will keep you up to date on any new articles. If you have any thoughts or suggestions for improvements, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

			<p>Over the last couple of months, I’ve been working with <a href="https://www.brapp.tv">Brapp</a> on their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8">v2.0 release</a> which adds a ton of new features for video makers, producers, and music lovers.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-audio.jpg" width="800" height="542" /></p>

<p>For video makers, there is a huge improvement to the record and upload flow allowing for studio grade Audio FX such as Pump (compression), EQ, bpm centric Delays, and Reverb<sup id="fnref:anotherdev"><a href="#fn:anotherdev" class="footnote">1</a></sup> with adjustments occuring in real time. You can tap on the camera view to adjust exposure and light balance and the recording quality has been improved. Finally, you can now save videos locally complete with a watermark with your name and the beat creator if applicable.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-beat-trim.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>For producers, there is now a systemwide ability to import beats from any app that displays media files. Just tap the share icon and choose the new “Copy to Brapp” option. This will take you to a new editing page that lets you trim the beat to a minute or less in length and add optional fades in or out. The trim page was particularly difficult to build (as you have real time scrubbing and fades, waveform generation, and the ability to move the waveform before you even get to outputting these to a single audio file) but the end result works beautifully.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-profile.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>In addition to these big features, there are 100s<sup id="fnref:literally"><a href="#fn:literally" class="footnote">2</a></sup> of smaller changes including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The new profile system makes it possible to hide reposts on a profile so you can just check out their beats and videos.</li>
  <li>Search is more powerful than ever.</li>
  <li>It is easier to find new people to follow in the new Explore section.</li>
  <li>You can now see trending hashtags as they happen in Search &gt; Videos/Beats.</li>
  <li>Certified. OGs on Brapp will now have the Certified icon by their name<sup id="fnref:certified"><a href="#fn:certified" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>It is now easier to find beats that are used in videos.</li>
  <li>It is now easier to save beats you like with the new “Save Beat” button.</li>
  <li>You now get notifications on reposts, so you can see when your followers react to your reposts.</li>
  <li>Check out your Mug Shot in Profile &gt; Settings.</li>
  <li>You can now see all the beats and videos you have Liked in Settings &gt; My Likes.</li>
  <li>It is now easier to Invite friends to Brapp via Facebook or SMS.</li>
  <li>Lots of stability and speed improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, previous versions of the app were written in Swift 1.2 using Xcode 6.4 and the iOS 8 SDK. With this build, I migrated it to Swift 2.1 using Xcode 7 and the iOS 9 SDK. This means, among other things, that there is now San Francisco rather than Helvetica Neue throughout!</p>

<p>As ever, Brapp has been a really fun project to work on. I can’t say enough good things about the people behind it and I really believe this app is going to be a big deal. If you haven’t checked it out yet, you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8">get Brapp for free on the App Store</a>. You can also read about the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/">initial build and release</a> and the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/11/27/brapp-v1.1/">v1.1 update last November</a>.</p>

      <p>The audio filters were written by <a href="http://bangmeansdoit.co.uk/en/">David Gibson</a>; I did the integration with the Brapp project and UI. <a href="#fnref:anotherdev" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>I am currently certified though I don’t think I will be for long bearing in mind I only have two ‘raps’ and I’m miming in both of them. I did record some sick beats during development but I deleted them pretty quick after recording! <a href="#fnref:certified" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

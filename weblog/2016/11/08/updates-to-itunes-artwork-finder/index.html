			<p>Last week, my <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/">iTunes Artwork Finder</a> script stopped working due to some <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/192916">changes by Apple</a> with regards to rate limiting. In the past, searching for something on my site would cause my server to send a request to Apple and get the data back but with so many people using it my server would get blocked within a few seconds.</p>

<p>After a brief shutdown<sup id="fnref:thanks"><a href="#fn:thanks" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, I’m happy to say that my iTunes Artwork Finder is now back up and running again thanks to a few tweaks. Now, instead of sending all requests from my server, it works like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When you enter a search term (i.e. “Fall out boy” albums in United Kingdom), that is sent to my server where I’ll generate the correct URL that is needed for Apple’s servers</li>
  <li>Your browser then takes that URL to make the request directly to Apple</li>
  <li>When the data is returned from Apple, the browser then sends it to my server for processing</li>
  <li>Results are then displayed!</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that there are now 3 network requests instead of 1 but the crucial part is that all requests to Apple’s servers are now made from your own browser so the rate limiting shouldn’t be a problem<sup id="fnref:ratelimit"><a href="#fn:ratelimit" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Whilst not an ideal solution, it does work and means I can keep everything running for a bit longer. I’m hopeful that Apple will alter how their rate limiting works as at the moment it seems a bit broken, especially with it being required for several apps with the new <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/">Apple Music APIs</a>.</p>

<p>The code for the artwork finder is <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder">available on GitHub</a> although this uses the old PHP request system rather than my new version as that should be more than good enough for personal usage<sup id="fnref:personalusage"><a href="#fn:personalusage" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you run into any problems, <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">please get in touch</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:thanks">
      <p>During which I received around 80 emails hoping that it would come back online - thanks! It’s nice to know that so many people use the site; I have no analytics on my website so seeing so many people get in touch made me realise how big it has become. <a href="#fnref:thanks" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:ratelimit">
      <p>Unless you try and do around 50 searches in short succession in which case you’ll need to wait a bit before you can make more requests. <a href="#fnref:ratelimit" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:personalusage">
      <p>And if you want to do more than just personal usage you should <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">speak to me</a> first as I don’t really want people to create entire duplicates of my own project. <a href="#fnref:personalusage" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

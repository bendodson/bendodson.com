			<p>I had an email this morning from a developer who wanted to connect directly to my <a href="https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/">iTunes Artwork Finder</a> in order to power their own artwork finding app. This seemed like a good time to point out that there is no need to do this<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as I have the source code freely available for everyone on <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a developer and you want to use my API for iTunes Artwork, please instead get the source code and host it on your own server. You can get the code from <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder">https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder</a></p>

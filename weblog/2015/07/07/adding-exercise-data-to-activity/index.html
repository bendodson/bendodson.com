			<p>I&#39;ve been using the health features of the Apple watch <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/26/working-out-with-apple-watch/">a lot recently</a> but today is the first time it has stopped me from doing a specific exercise. I was planning on going for a swim but obviously I don&#39;t want to do that with my watch on. I assumed I&#39;d be able to either enter the workout directly into the Health app (or use a 3rd party app to add the data to HealthKit) and that would then count as part of my 30 minutes of exercise on the Apple Watch; unfortunately this is not the case.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried with manual data entry and 3rd party apps<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but there is no way for workout data not created on the Apple Watch to be used as part of your Activity... yet. On checking the WWDC keynote, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02H3vfFW3xg&amp;t=1h31m53s">Kevin Lynch mentions that this feature is coming as part of watchOS 2</a>. Specifically he says that &quot;workouts with these [native on the Apple Watch] apps will count&quot; - I&#39;m assuming that any app that uses HealthKit will actually count but we&#39;ll see. I&#39;m not going to install a potentially buggy watchOS 2 on my Apple Watch one week before Apple Pay comes to the UK!</p>

<p>I even built my own basic app to add data into HealthKit with the &quot;user entered&quot; flag set to false in the hope that this was the piece that meant the Apple Watch ignored it.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

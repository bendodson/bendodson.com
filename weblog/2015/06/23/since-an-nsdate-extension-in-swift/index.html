			<p>I’ve just <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/nsdate-since-swift">committed a very simple NSDate extension</a> that gives you a human readable version of the time difference between the date and now (i.e. “2 hours ago”, “just now”, or “last week”). I needed this functionality in a project I’m currently working on but existing solutions I found were all Objective-C and fairly complex. I try not to add any complex 3rd party dependencies when I don’t have to (especially as I don’t want an Objective-C bridging header) so I built this in a few minutes to give me the basic functionality I required.

<p>In many ways, this sums up how I feel about some development today. Many developers will either embed a 3rd party solution without thinking about it (giving you licensing and support issues in the future) or they’ll spend hours crafting the perfect solution that will give you to-the-second precision with unit tests and a whole host of other stuff you probably don’t need<sup id="fnref:craft"><a href="#fn:craft" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Sometimes you just need the simplest thing that works so you can move onto more important things.</p>

      <p>An <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/">oft-mentioned story about Steve Jobs</a> regards how his father would spend as much time making the back of a cabinet (which you’d never see) look as good as the front as a sign of good craftsmanship. This has its place but its important to remember that “<a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt">real artists ship</a>”; I’d rather have a project that is live and performing than spend hours crafting the “perfect” piece of code. <a href="#fnref:craft" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re on O2’s UK mobile network (not ADSL), you’ll (probably) see a line beginning with <code>x-up-calling-line-id</code> - followed by your mobile phone number in plain text</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like O2 is sending users mobile phone numbers in plain text over HTTP headers to every site they visit whilst using their network. At the moment the issue appears to be limited to certain APNS on the UK O2 network.</p>

<p>When asked about it, <a href="https://twitter.com/o2/status/161872584634408960">O2 responded with</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mobile number in the HTML is linked to how the site determines that your browsing from a mobile device</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Lewis points out, a “<a href="https://twitter.com/lewispeckover/status/161879864159383552">User-agent header ID’s the device</a>” so this seems a slightly odd stance (particularly as it isn’t happening on all mobile devices).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> O2 say that it’s a technical error and that this header should only be sent to whitelisted servers. It does beg the question, which servers are whitelisted? Presumably just O2’s own websites but it’s still not good to be sending information like this in plaintext.</p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CEO of Monkeybin emailed me with a few corrections to this piece. Be sure to read the updates at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>I get contacted by quite a few developers of iOS apps asking for me to write a review up on my blog. Occasionally I agree and I'm always completely honest and independent in my thoughts. If I don't like the app, I say so and this is either met with annoyance ("we only wanted you to publish a good review") or with good grace ("thanks for your honest review - we've taken your criticisms on board and aim to fix them for the next release"). Today, I received an email from <a href="http://monkeybin.no/">Monkeybin Studios</a> asking me to review their game "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jumpship-thrust-control/id422849746?mt=8">Jumpship Thrust Control</a>". Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true...</p>
<p>This was a bit of an odd one (as you'll see in a moment) so I think I'll review the app by listing the email that was sent below and then dissecting each section. This will hopefully serve as a) a review of the app and b) as a lesson on how not to ask for iOS app reviews (not just from me, but from any blog or review site).</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Hi Fellow Gamer!</p>
	<p>Please find attached details of Jumpship Thrust Control 2 - a new game on the scene for iPhone and iPad users - we’d love it if you can review it on your site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds interesting - maybe I'll review it. Shame they didn't include a download link to the game though as it's actually version 2.0 of an app called "JumpShip Thrust Control". The first time I searched for it (copying and pasting the name), iTunes couldn't find it. Also, there is no detail here (or later in the email) of pricing information. I've no idea if this is a paid app (in which case, where is free promotional code so I can download it) or a free app. Turns out this is a free app and you can use In-App Purchases to unlock later levels. If you are asking for a review of your app, be sure to include pricing information (as it's a key review metric) as well as any promotional codes so that a reviewer can use the full app.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Give it a try – we promise the top-notch graphics and the old school side-scroller “action” nature of the game will have you hooked. It’s a throwback to the days of Atari and Commodore 64 video gaming but with 2012 style graphics!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2012 style graphics you say? An interesting pitch when games like Infinity Blade II came out in 2011. By way of demonstration, here is a screenshot of the app:</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0095.png" alt="IMG_0095.PNG" title="IMG_0095.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>I think that pretty much speaks for itself. An oil type background (looks alright) with some clipart stuck on top. The only bit that I could claim is even modern is that the flames at the back move a little bit but I believe this is a fairly simple effect to do with Cocos2D so we shouldn't put too much stock in it.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>When I say “new game” Jumpship Thrust Control is actually a completely re-vamped and much improved version of an existing game from the team at Monkeybin Studios; you have to steer a spaceship through many different types of beautiful but hazardous terrain, navigating many evil obstacles in the way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first read this sentence, I thought "ah good, at least they admit it's a rip-off game" but then they go on to say that it's a remake of one of their old games! I think you'll find that this exact game mechanic has been popularised oh so many times before. Here's a small history of these games:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Cobra">Super Cobra</a> (Atari game from 1983 - the original game of this type I believe)
<li><a href="http://www.helicoptergame.net/">Helicopter Game</a> (Flash game made in 2004 - the most well known on the internet)</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/helicopter/id322998366?mt=8">Helicopter</a> (iPhone version of the above two games - blatant copying in 2009)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just a very quick run through how this game has appeared over the years but there are hundreds of copies with different types of vehicle ranging from tractors to spaceships. This is just another one of those that doesn't even try to avoid the obvious link in that the first level is "cave" where every helicopter version of this genre starts. Why is a spaceship in a cave (and <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Exogorth">are they sure it's a cave</a>?). They could have at least tried a funny parody to make this game different in the same way that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/baby-monkey-going-backwards/id447960108?mt=8">Baby Monkey (Going Backwards On A Pig)</a> did with the platforming genre, but no, it's just a shameless copy.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Gamers said the previous version was too difficult and there was nothing to cater for the serious gamers over the casual gamers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's clarify something here; there are casual gamers and there are serious gamers. Serious gamers play on the PS3 and Xbox, casual games play on the Wii and on mobile phones (with the possible exception of Infinity Blade II which is console quality on the iPhone). This is a casual game by the fact that it's horribly repetitive and is the sort of thing you play on the tube when you've finished reading the paper.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The many improvements in the new version include 3 different player modes (beginner, intermediate and expert) plus 5 new terrains to master and easier controls for the spaceship; there’s also a training mode built in to get you up to speed with controlling the spaceship before you try the beginners’ level for real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New terrains and level difficulty does not a "serious gamer" game make. If they'd wanted to make it more competitive they should have put in some sort of peer-to-peer mechanic where two people start at the same time on different devices and the first one to die loses. If they'd wanted to make it more engaging over a long time period (rather than a pick up and play kind of game) then they should have put in a levelling system with spaceship upgrades (which you could charge real money for with In-App Purchasing). Adding a difficulty level isn't going to make all the Battlefield 3 and Skyrim players drop their controllers and pick up this app instead.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Just to make your life easier, we attach a couple of reviews we have already written that highlight some of the key features of the game. Perhaps you can cut and paste some of the comments and claim them as your own review?! (Just thinking of your time. :))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the part of the email where I made up my mind to do a review of the app. You can download and read their prewritten reviews: <a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/jumpship-review-1.doc">review #1</a> and <a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/jumpship-review-2.doc">review #2</a>.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know where to start but this is sort of behaviour is what I hate about the app industry in many ways. There are thousands of apps out there but they are hard to find unless you get coverage in the right places. That does not mean you email blogs with pre-written reviews asking them to "claim them as your own". Just don't do it. If you want to have your app reviewed, you have to accept that people may not like it sometimes. Take their criticism, and improve your app. It's insulting to be given pre-written content as you're basically saying to the reviewer "we don't trust your judgement or other write-ups - just use our content".</p>
<p>That's not to say you shouldn't provide text to a reviewer, but it should be done as a press release. That way, they can pick and choose any interesting elements (e.g. "this is the first game to use x feature") and write it into their review without physically copying / pasting. You can also include reviews from other real people that show off good features of your app, particularly if you've had good press coverage from other outlets. But don't ever write your own reviews and ask people to use them. That is incredibly underhand and doesn't do either the journalism or app development industries any favours.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Thanks in advance for taking a look at our game and Happy Jumpshipping!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've got a few thoughts on the app which I haven't covered above so I'll quickly list them:</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong> - there is only 1 level included with the game followed by 4 trial levels that you get a little distance with before being asked to make an In-App Purchase. There is also a boss level which can be purchased. Both In-App Purchases cost 69p which is fair enough but this isn't detailed anywhere in the app description. The description says "5 great new landscape levels", the "what's new" text says "5 NEW LEVELS", and the email I got said "5 new terrains to master". At no point does it say you'll need to purchase these until you're in the game. It's a free game, so it's understandable you'll have to pay at some point, but it's deceptive to list "5 levels" everywhere when you are actually only getting one with your download.</p>
<p><strong>Bugs</strong> - it's buggy as hell. On my second go on the first level, my ship would no longer blow up. Here's a photo of something that just shouldn't happen on a game thats main bit of code is "if ship hits wall, ship explodes".</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0103.png" alt="IMG_0103.PNG" title="IMG_0103.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>As well as that issue, the UI would freeze if I closed the app and came back to it whilst it was on the pause menu. Music would still play but I couldn't touch anything so had to force quit the app. That would be annoying if you were on a high-score streak and got a text message or a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong> - training mode is apparently designed to be a place where you can't crash in order to get you used to the game. They don't tell you this anywhere in the app though so you'd be forgiven for wondering what is going on as the game never ends, you can't crash, and no power-ups or walls appear anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Power-ups</strong> - there are power ups littered through the game (with icons that look like they were plucked from windows 95) but no description of what they do. You have to learn by trial and error that a blue orb means you can delete a bit of level or that something that looks like a move cursor is actually a power up to shrink you temporarily.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Overall the game is just plain awful. When you take into account the deception around In-App Purchases and that they are trying to get reviewers to post pre-written reviews, it becomes a despicable game. Very little thought has gone into gameplay or design and the only reason I even downloaded it was as an example of how to demonstrate what not to do.</p>
<p>In terms of how you should market your apps, I can strongly recommend putting together a good media pack such as the one outlined by <a href="http://retrodreamer.com/blog/2011/08/how-to-media-kits-retro-dreamer-style/">Retro Dreamer</a> (linked to from <a href="http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/4/">iOS Dev Weekly Issue 4</a>, a must subscription for iOS developers). I have a <a href="http://highlightsapp.com/files/media-kit.zip">media kit</a> for my apps such as <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8">Highlights</a> which has some screenshots, information, and release notes that allow any reviewers to have a complete overview of the app. If you follow that guide, you'll find you get a lot more responses from app reviewers than if you follow the example taken by Monkeybin Studios.</p>
<p><strong>Update (12th December 2011):</strong> I replied to the email to let them know I'd put this review up and got the following response:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Hi Ben,</p>
	<p>Thanks for your review. We respect your opinion and we have taken notes of our mistakes and your sugesstions. Hopefully we'll do better in future. We respect your judgment, pre-written reviews were just because of the fact that many webmasters may receive hundreds of emails daily and they may not find a time to write for every one.</p>
	<p>Anyways, Thanks again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have respect for a company that actually replies to negative criticism so that's good at least. I still think the app can be vastly improved and hopefully we'll see that happen in this case at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Update (15th December 2011):</strong> Today I received an email from the CEO of Monkeybin to let me know that the person who contacted me regarding writing a review was not in fact an employee of Monkeybin but instead a freelancer who had operated outside of their remit.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Hi Ben,</p>
	<p>My name is Haakon Langaas Lageng, and I am the CEO at Monkeybin. You have been in touch with <strong>***</strong>, and I would like to point out that <strong>***</strong> is not a Monkeybin employee.</p>
	<p>We hired them as a freelancing marketing manager to do the promotions for JumpShip Thrust Control, and it got out of hand. They were free to do the promotions the way they thought would be best, since we were pressed on time doing other projects. It resulted in methods that is not up to Monkeybin's ethics or standards, and not how we want to be perceived by the gaming community.</p>
	<p>As the CEO of Monkeybin, this is of course completely my responsibility. Unfortunately, what was happening here slipped my eyes. I found out only yesterday what has been going on.</p>
	<p>I just saw on your site that <strong>***</strong> sent you an "explanation" on the 12th December, and I am sorry they got around doing that before I put the brakes on.</p>
	<p>If you are going to publish what I just wrote here, please omit <strong>***</strong> name. They made some bad judgements, yes, but in the end, as I said, it is all my responsibility.</p>
	<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes a lot of guts for a CEO to claim ultimate responsibility for an error by a contractor rather than trying to use it as an excuse and I applaud Haakon for it. Let this be a lesson to everybody that you should fully research anybody you ask to promote apps for you and ensure you stay on top of what is being done in your companies name.</p>

			<p>After seeing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo">SiriProxy in action on YouTube</a>, I was keen to grab an iPhone 4S to have a play with it. I managed to pick one up at the Apple Store yesterday and today I'm pleased to release my first SiriProxy plugin; <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/SiriProxy-TubeUpdates">TubeUpdates</a>. It's a basic plugin that lets you ask Siri for the status of a London Underground line thanks to my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/">TubeUpdates API</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0066.png" alt="SiriProxy-TubeUpdates - A standard request" title="IMG_0066.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>I've not dabbled with Ruby for a while but building the plugin was fairly straightforward. All of the code is <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/SiriProxy-TubeUpdates/">available on GitHub</a> but the main piece looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">listen_for</span> <span class="sr">/[what is,what&#39;s] the status of (.*)/i</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="o">|</span>
	<span class="n">encodedline</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;+&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">URI</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;http://tubeupdates.com/siri/?line=&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">encodedline</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">json</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Net</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">url</span>
	<span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">JSON</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span> <span class="n">json</span>
	<span class="n">say</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
    
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;messages&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
	    <span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ask</span> <span class="s2">&quot;There are additional details. Would you like to hear them?&quot;</span>
	    <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=~</span> <span class="sr">/yes/i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#process their response            </span>
	        <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;messages&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">|</span>
	            <span class="n">say</span> <span class="n">message</span>
	        <span class="p">}</span>
	    <span class="k">end</span>
	<span class="k">end</span>
	<span class="n">request_completed</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The matching in the first line ensures that you can ask either "what is (or what's) the status of (the line name)". This is then url encoded and "the line name" is sent to a Siri endpoint I created on the Tube Updates site. The site will return a JSON string of the tube line status which is then parsed and spoken back to the user. E.g. "The Circle line is running a good service".</p>
<p>If there are any messages for the line (these are generally details of delays), then an additional step is performed; the user is asked if they would like to hear the details and answering "yes" will list them.</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0065.png" alt="SiriProxy-TubeUpdates - A delayed line" title="IMG_0065.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>And that's pretty much it! I've got a few ideas for more complex plugins that can interface directly with iPhone apps so I'll have a play with those when I get a spare moment. If you've got any comments or feature requests for this plugin, then <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is the first project I've published that is written in Ruby and the first time I've put anything up on GitHub.</p>

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2011/12/03/goodbye-gowalla/">Goodbye Gowalla</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2011-12-03" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/12/03/goodbye-gowalla/">December 03, 2011</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>I'd originally been planning to post up a review of Gowalla v4 (late I know, but it was fairly in-depth look at a company gone mad) but last nights news that Gowalla is to be acquired by Facebook means that I've bought forward another post I'd been planning; my goodbye to Gowalla. After being a loyal user for just over 2 years, the time has finally come for me to delete the app that has been a key part of my life for a rather long time.   
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
Gowalla was built by a company called Alamofire (before they changed their name to just Gowalla) and I became acquainted to it via one of their other projects; <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/packrat/">PackRat</a>. It was a game that involved collecting sets of cards with different icons on was pretty addictive. When they decided to make a mobile game, I assumed it would be similar to PackRat but with a location element. Instead, Gowalla was created allowing you to check-in at places as well as collect virtual items. The collection part wasn't terribly well thought out and went through several iterations but it garnered quite a cult following. In addition to items, you could collect "stamps" by checking in at locations and "pins" by completing tasks (e.g. check in at 10 different coffee shops).</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/100-stamps.png" alt="My first 100 stamps!" title="100-stamps.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>For a time, everything was rosy. New items would come out on a Tuesday (leading to mass checkins at the categories the item was likely to appear at) and people were steadily competing to see how many stamps they could get. I think the highest I ever saw was somebody who had checked in at over 9500 places.</p>
<p>During 2009, I quit playing PackRat as they introduced a number of changes which made the game less enjoyable (e.g. locking key cards unless you got friends to join the game, adding "bling"). This was probably a premonition of things to come as Gowalla would eventually make the same mistake - disenfranchising their core audience rather than embracing it.</p>

<h3>Developing for Gowalla</h3>
<p>In October 2009 I <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/07/gowalla-tools-web-app-find-your-missing-gowalla-items/">created a basic web app for iPhone</a> that would allow you to find items by showing you the categories that were most likely to drop a specific item. It proved to be incredibly popular, so over Christmas 2009 I introduced 13 new tools or web apps in a project I called "Gowalla Tools" which ranged from being able to view Flickr photos at Gowalla spots to temporarily turning Gowalla.com into a PackRat game (thanks to some JavaScript) which would allow people to collect coins which were then used to give out prizes. This again was so popular that I started to devote more time to making apps that ran on top of Gowalla. There wasn't an official API when I started but by early 2010, Gowalla launched the first version of their API. This is where things started to deteriorate…</p>

<h3>The Fallout</h3>
<p>The new API started out with good intentions, but constant breakages and undocumented changes made it a frustration to use, let alone build apps with. At the time, I'd been working on a native iPhone app but there was no way it could go out with the Gowalla API as it was. Had Gowalla altered anything, then the app would have remained broken until I could fix it and then sit through the 2 week Apple App Review process - not ideal. So it was that I rallied together a few other developers and a number of Gowalla players and wrote a letter entitled "<a href="http://gowallatools.com/api/">Thoughts On The Gowalla API</a>". Gowalla never replied or apologised (and one of the team called me a "jackass" when I met them at SXSW a year later) but the API did eventually improve months later.</p>

<h3>The Reconcilliation</h3>
<p>In August 2010, after the API had been updated and a number of (highly priced) apps had been built on top of it, I decided to <a href="http://vimeo.com/14045036">relaunch Gowalla Tools</a>. Initially it was going to be called "Gowalla Plus" but that idea didn't sit well with Gowalla:</p>

	<p>Hey Ben,</p>
	<p>Adam sent along your email to me regarding naming conventions. Hopefully I can address both of our concerns in this email.</p>
	<p>These are always sticky situations because we want to support the app developers building great apps on the API, but we also need to avoid confusion from both a legal and customer support standpoint. You've likely observed that our naming conventions follow this standard approach:</p>
	<p>Gowalla for iPhone, Gowalla for iPad, Gowalla for Android, etc.</p>
	<p>I'm afraid GowallaPlus is simply too close to our mark and if we let it fly, we have to let everything fly from a trademark standpoint. To be honest, I've always been a concerned about GowallaTools, but have wanted to avoid hassling you.</p>
	<p>We deal with complaints and support email every week from folks who believe certain apps sold in the iTunes store starting with Gowalla in their names are actually our product. We'll be working with each of these developers to change their names.</p>
	<p>I'm not against a mention of Gowalla in the name. I just can't have the name on the front side.</p>
	<p>[ProductName] for Gowalla would be acceptable.</p>
	<p>The likelihood of folks believing GowallaPlus is our app is super high, based on our experience with the other apps in the store.</p>
	<p>Thanks for letting us know your thoughts in advance. I'm in hopes we can encourage you to develop your own brand name for your line up of products. I think you've got a good thing going.</p>
	<p>Related: I'd love to get a beta of the "travel edition" if you're open to it. I'm traveling to South America later this month and would love to give it run. Seems perfect!</p>
	<p>Let me know your thoughts and questions. I know we haven't always been your favorite guys to be developing with, but I hope we can find some solutions here that work for everyone.</p>
	<p>Thanks Ben!</p>

<p>Of course, no other app was ever actually removed for having the word "Gowalla" in it. In any case, I decided to rebrand my projects as "Wallabee" and started off by releasing my <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/wallabee/#travel">"Wallabee: Travel Edition" app</a>; an app that let you check-in multiple people on Gowalla with more than 99% savings on data usage (which translates into big savings if you're using data roaming). Unfortunately, despite being a free app (and the encouragement from Josh above), Gowalla never publicised it in anyway e.g. on their Twitter feed or blog.</p>

<p>Over Christmas 2010, I <a href="http://wallab.ee/xmas2010/">unleashed some plans for further apps and developments</a> including an Item Hunter, Time Travel Edition (showing historical changes to places), and version 2 of the Travel Edition app. Unfortunately the release of version 2.0 was <a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/2010/12/14/travel-edition-2-0-delay-due-to-functionality-changes/">delayed</a> due to Gowalla having an issue with the mass check-in facility I'd added.</p>
<p>Finally, in March 2011, myself and a number of good friends I've made through Gowalla launched the <a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/">Wallabee Pouch</a>, a definitive guide to all aspects of Gowalla. It also featured the "<a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/directory/">Item Directory</a>", the largest repository of information about Gowalla items including real-time item drop rates and statistics.</p>

<h3>SXSW / Re-evaluation</h3>
<p>In late 2010, I decided to head over to Austin for SXSW in March 2011 as I was keen to meet up with the Gowalla team and a few other Gowalla players were all heading over for a week of item hunting, stamp collecting, and general socialising. I'd also opened up a conversation with Gowalla around their vacancy for an iPhone developer so I was keen to have a discussion about it whilst I was there. Unfortunately, things turned out slightly different to how I imagined. I saw firsthand some of the pettiness and childlike behaviour that certain players exhibited around items and suddenly realised why Gowalla tried not to have much to do with their original players if they all acted like that. Despite organising a meet up around the iPhone developer role, it fell through with the HR contact failing to arrange anything (apparently a systemic problem within the company - departments often have no interaction with each other and there is "rampant disorganisation" - that was a quote from an employee).</p>
<p>The most important part for me of SXSW was listening to Josh's talk on the future of location-based services, a talk that I still maintain is one of the most interesting I've ever attended. It was at that point that I realised the writing was on the wall for the item-based gamification of Gowalla and that they would eventually change into just being a service based on check-ins. I decided to stop focussing on items and <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/">stood down from Wallabee</a> to focus on making travel based tools instead. My premonition turned out to be correct when <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/post/9378150015/going-forward">Gowalla announced that items wouldn't be making it</a> to the next version of the app in August 2011.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Once I'd stopped working on Wallabee, I started focussing intently on my next big project; <a href="http://highlightsapp.com/">Highlights</a>. It was an app that would help you find the best places around you by using recommendations from other users. The twist was that it used location data from both Foursquare and Gowalla and used a complex algorithm to rank them based on comments, tips, highlights, photos, etc. It also pulled in vast amounts of data from other services like Last.fm, Yelp, and Flickr. To power the system, I tapped into the Pubsubhubbub hub for Gowalla courtesy of <a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> - this allowed me to get every checkin that happened on Gowalla in real-time and build up my own vast database of checkin data and locations thus bypassing the need to directly connect to Gowalla's API (due to the issues I'd had previously). You can <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/07/25/the-inside-story-on-powering-highlights/">read more about the integration in a post I did about it</a> if that sort of thing interests you!</p>
<p>On September 2nd (which also happened to be my birthday), Apple made Highlights their "iPad App of the Week".</p>
<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0001.png" alt="Highlights - iPad App of the Week" title="IMG_0001.PNG" border="0" /></p>
<p>I sent some promotional codes direct to Josh (and a few other Gowalla staff members) in the hope that they might at least tweet about the app or put up a blog post about it as they had for other apps (although I found out later that the one app they publicised was part-built by one of their developers). As a one-man development studio, a single tweet from Gowalla would have made a big difference in the number of downloads but unfortunately it didn't happen. Despite being featured by Apple, given high ratings on app review sites, and being reviewed in numerous magazines and popular sites (such as TUAW), Gowalla didn't want to acknowledge it. </p>
<p>If I was running a company with an API and one of the apps got a lot of good press, I'd be the first person to try and publicise it as it can only benefit both parties. It still surprises me that Gowalla never understood 3rd party developers and I often wonder why they even bothered making a public API.</p>

<h3>Gowalla v4.0</h3>
<p>During September 2011, Gowalla released version 4.0 of their app to great fanfare at TechCrunch Disrupt. On the surface, it looked like a solid update. A beautiful design and a core rethinking of the product meant that they were stepping in the direction I thought they would after the talk at SXSW. However, once I got to use the app, I couldn't believe how badly wrong they had got it. I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail on it (as I believe the app will disappear soon anyway) but here are my main points about what is wrong with Gowalla v4:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stories</strong> - The fundamental idea that a check-in is a story is genius. Whilst going to the grocery store isn't really worthy of a "story", there are many times when story is exactly the word to use. When I heard about it, I thought that Gowalla would extend the great work they'd done on starting and ending points of journeys. They had previously put out an update which would show a little aeroplane graphic showing when people had travelled from one location to another and had gone further to detect when a journey had begun and ended. For instance, I got a "Survived SXSW" badge only once I got back to Gatwick Airport in the UK as that's when my SXSW journey had begun from. I imagined they'd use this so that if I went on holiday, it would detect that and bundle up all my checkins and photos as a single story. What actually happened is that a story is a single place only thing and is more about the people that are there rather than the places. It works great if you have lots of friends in a single place but it kind of sucks if you're doing a pub crawl or going to more than one place. The fact that people can also check you in despite not being there (some people kept saying "Ben's here" at spots in the US which kind of annoyed me) instantly made this a painful update.</li>
<li><strong>Notes</strong> - In Gowalla v3, you could leave notes for people at a spot. They could only read these notes when they checked in at that place. This was a great usage of the location-based nature of the app but was removed. Apparently it was going to be put back in at some point but it's never materialised.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong> - The main button on the Gowalla app is a section called "Guides". It's beautifully designed (looks a bit like the "popular" section of Highlights) but is completely inappropriate to be the main feature of the app. It basically shows you the best places to go in a city based on check-ins and what Gowalla have featured (as well as other companies like Disney and National Geographic). The problems are twofold; 1) it's poorly implemented (the top spot to visit in Disney's Animal Kingdom was Spaceship Earth, the iconic ride from Epcot - not quite right) and 2) it's limited to 60 places. This means that in the UK, the only guide is for London. The next nearest is Amsterdam. How this is of any use to people day-to-day is beyond me. The key feature should have been stories until such a point that guides were auto-generated (like Highlights is) at which point it could have been more prominent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just 3 of the main criticisms I have but overall the whole product is just lousy. Whilst it's beautiful to look at, very little thought has gone into how the user will engage the product as highlighted by the way Guides is the largest button in the interface. I also got really frustrated with the way that bits of the UI would load in later (so the photos might appear and then a few seconds later text would appear). This is obviously to keep loading times down but there is no indicator of it happening so the UI is constantly moving leading to a jarring experience. From a technical point of view, it has obviously not undergone any external testing as it crashes a huge amount.</p>

<p>Overall, the product felt like it had been rushed to get it out for TechCrunch Disrupt. Rather than pausing and releasing a top-rate product, they pushed out a half-built poorly thought out mess and they have suffered for it. Whilst there are many reviews hammering them for removing items (and not delivering on their promise of letting people export them in a "really cool way"), there are hundreds of 1 star reviews on iTunes from people hating the new update for the reasons above. I think the biggest problem is that they removed functionality without replacing it within anything better. Also, the changes weren't communicated to regular users. My mum, for example, loved using Gowalla v3 but when v4 came up she had no idea what had happened. She, like many users, doesn't read the Gowalla blog or see the updates on TechCrunch so had no idea that items were going or that they were going to fundamentally change direction.</p>

<p>How could it have been done better? I had always thought that Gowalla would spin off into two kick-ass products; a game (based on items) and a check-in service (with stories as I described them). Instead, it cut off the bit it didn't like and released an updated check-in service that did less than it promised. It doesn't aid in the discovery of places and it doesn't aid in the telling of stories.</p>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>After a torrent of negative feedback, suspicions grew that Gowalla would be shut down during November 2011. Many of their employees had started using Foursquare and it looked like several prominent members of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/etherbrian/status/137330108997443586">staff had been sacked</a>. To make matters worse, Gowalla v4.0.3 had mysteriously disappeared from the App Store without warning. When rumours emerged that Gowalla was <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/30/technology/startup_acquisitions/">looking for a buyer</a> (and had been brushed off by Google and Groupon) I thought that they would definitely be disappearing. Who would want to buy a company that had made such a monumental cockup and was haemorrhaging users?</p>

<p>Ah, Facebook.</p>

<p>Using a tactic referred to as "aqhiring", it would appear that Facebook is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/02/technology/gowalla_facebook/index.htm">buying Gowalla out</a> and taking some of the employees to Facebook HQ to work on a new timeline feature. This most likely means that Gowalla will close down (and I'd imagine PackRat with it) as all the staff are reassigned to Facebook projects - I think it highly unlikely that Gowalla will survive as a Facebook product or keep going alone.</p>

<p>Many people are now worried about data from Gowalla being moved over to Facebook. We'll have to wait and see if this actually happens but in the mean time a large number of people are deleting their Gowalla accounts to keep their privacy safe. I'm now officially done with Gowalla and today I did the same.</p>

<h3>In closing...</h3>

<p>Gowalla has been a big part of my life for the past couple of years. I've made some great friends and I've had some truly great experiences. Discovering new places when looking for items was a highlight and I'm proud of the apps and features I was able to build on top of Gowalla. However, there have also been some truly horrible times both with Gowalla itself and some of the people that have played it. Whilst I wish them all the best, I honestly don't think Gowalla is going to survive in it's current form and I don't think that it should.</p>

<p>To finish off, I'd like to thank everybody who made Gowalla a great experience for me from the people I've met playing to those that supported the apps I built. I'd also like to personally thank 3 people at Gowalla who helped me out when they could and to whom I'm very grateful; Jon Carroll, Adam McManus, and Andrew Dupont. I hope they get what they want from the transition that is about to happen.</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank whoever at Gowalla designed this icon for my "Ben Dodson Apps" spot...</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/422-0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08-200.png" alt="422 0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08 200" title="422-0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08-200.png" border="0" width="200" height="200" style="border: 0" /></p>

<p>It was never sent to me (I found it on their server - don't ask) and they never used it on my spot page (saying they don't do portraits for spot icons) but I've always really liked it over the one that was <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/7127793">eventually used</a>.</p>

    	<div>
			<p>A few weeks ago, Gowalla released version 4.0 of their app to an overwhelmingly negative response. I myself will be posting a review soon but in this quick post I wanted to share a few tips on how to use the new API that is powering the app as an official API is apparently not coming until Q1 2012.   
In a post entitled "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/880cc4a5de51e016">Where the Gowalla API is going</a>" on the official Gowalla Developers Group, it was revealed that most bits of the existing API "should be working" but a version 2 of the API would be coming in 2012 that enables developers to leverage the new features such as stories, lists, likes, guides, and so on. Unfortunately, several parts of the existing API broke on launch of the new app (including OAuth integration which took out nearly all 3rd party apps, trips, and an advanced search API) and some parts were completely removed (such as PubSubhubbub, one of the key things that actually made the Gowalla API a compelling thing to use). I have a number of apps that use the old API and were affected in small ways (I learnt long ago never to make direct calls to the Gowalla API) but there were a few things like trips that I needed direct access to more immediately. So, I spent a few minutes digging into the new Gowalla app and found the new connection details that are required to talk to the new API.</p>

<p>It's actually fairly easy! Firstly, instead of connecting to http://api.gowalla.com/ change the URL to <strong>https://api9000.gowalla.com/</strong></p>

<p>Next, there are 4 headers you have to send with every request. 2 of them, "<code>Accept: application/json</code>" and "<code>X-Gowalla-API-Key</code>", were required for the old API but Gowalla have also added an "<code>X-Gowalla-Bruce-Lee</code>" header (with a password so they know it's the Gowalla app using the API) and an "<code>X-Gowalla-API-Version</code>" header which seems to suggest they are taking my advice of 18 months ago and versioning the API rather than just breaking existing apps. So, the full headers you need to send are:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Accept: application/json
X-Gowalla-API-Key: YOUR-API-KEY-HERE
X-Gowalla-Bruce-Lee: l33tkuned0
X-Gowalla-API-Version: 2</code></pre></div>

<p>If you do that, you should be able to call an API endpoint such as users/bendodson where you'll find a load of new data that isn't in the normal API. That should also give you a good idea of the naming conventions of new endpoints (e.g. /lists rather than /trips). In all of my testing, existing features such as OAuth have worked fine.</p>

<p>As a final example, the trips detail API is still broken on the current API (despite this being "looked into" 2 weeks ago). If you were to request <code>trips/168</code> you'll get a 404 not found error. This is one of the many broken API calls that is affecting apps that are currently out in the wild. However, if you change your code to use the new URL and the new headers, you can request <code>lists/168</code> to get full details of the trip you are after. Some of the keys will have changed name but it should be enough to get your app at least up and running.</p>

<p>Obviously, you use all of the above at your own risk. Gowalla are unlikely to break anything immediately as any changes to the headers, endpoints, or keys will break their app. However, there will probably be changes as and when they release new versions of their apps.</p>

<p>I have been very vocal on both <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/12/one-year-on-further-thoughts-on-the-gowalla-api/">the good</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/12/gowalla-api-problems/">the bad</a> points of the Gowalla API in the past. There had been a real effort to alert 3rd party developers to changes in recent months but the new v4 app fundamentally broke important parts of the API (particularly OAuth login) and fixes were slow coming or have still yet to come with regards to the /trips endpoint. Putting an API out for the new app in Q1 of next year is a very long time to wait for something that really should have launched alongside or shortly after the new app particularly as the API does already exist. In short, Gowalla really have a long way to improve in their dealings with 3rd party developers. Personally, I'm moving my apps away from Gowalla and starting to use other services but I'll be posting more about that soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update [25th Oct 2011]:</strong> Andrew Dupont responded to this article on the Gowalla Devs Group with:</p>

<blockquote><p>At any rate, we've fixed the trips API. Let me know if anything's still out of order.</p></blockquote>

<p>Turns out Gowalla will fix things if you complain enough...</p>

			<p>If you've been following my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/">blog</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/bendodson">twitter feed</a>, you'll know about my iOS app "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8">Highlights</a>" that lets you find interesting places around the world based on data from Gowalla and Foursquare. The app is doing phenomenally well in the UK becoming the #1 paid iPad travel app and reaching the top 20 of all paid iPad apps! I'm happy to announce that version 1.1 is now available as a free upgrade on the App Store and has a number of great new features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last.fm Events</strong> - When looking at a theatre, park, or music venue, Highlights will show you the upcoming events and let you tap through to Last.fm to find out more and list yourself as attending.</li>
<li><strong>Gowalla Trips</strong> - Each location can now show you every trip it has been added to on Gowalla. This isn't just the featured trips, but every single trip ever created. When you're looking at a trip, you can choose to add it to your planner with one tap making it really easy to plan a day out in a new town. Additionally, you can find trips near you via the planner and also search for trips around the world.</li>
<li><strong>View plans on a map</strong> - In the previous version, you could see your plans on a map if you were running the app on an iPad. With version 1.1 we've bought this feature to the iPhone as well. Just look at any of your plans and you'll find a new toggle to switch between list and map.</li>
<li><strong>Review Translation</strong> - When browsing reviews, you may come across some that aren't in English. Just double-tap the review to have it automatically translated!</li>
<li><strong>Faster Navigation</strong> - If you find yourself jumping from location to location via the trips or nearby spots features, you may find you have to go back through lots screens to get back to the first location you were looking at. You can now just hold down your finger on a back button anywhere in the app to be taken back to the first screen.</li> 
<li><strong>Report a Problem</strong> - Sometimes mistakes are made and old or incorrect data is pulled down through Foursquare or Gowalla. You can now tap a "Report a Problem" button on any location page to have it automatically flagged for us to fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are various speed improvements and bug fixes (including an issue with the iPad app not showing all of the screens in certain situations) - there is also the option to send a crash report anonymously in the unlikely event that the app crashes.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who has downloaded the app so far. If you enjoy this update, please leave a review on iTunes. If you run into any problems, please email me via help@highlightsapp.com before leaving a negative review as I'm unable to respond to reviews on iTunes.</p>

			<p>Last week I released my latest iOS app, "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8">Highlights</a>", which is designed to show you the best places in your area or anywhere in the world based on crowd sourced data from Gowalla and Foursquare. In this article, I want to explain how the recommendations engine works and also how I managed to solve some of the biggest challenges along the way.</p>

<h2>Search by recommendations</h2>

<p>During SXSW 2011, I made the decision to move away from doing development on apps based around Gowalla items and instead to apps based on travelling and discovery (mainly due to an <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/firewheel/where-are-we-going-sxsw-2011">excellent talk by Gowalla CEO Josh Williams</a> on the subject of check-in apps). It was in Austin that I had the idea for Highlights as I was constantly trying to find the best places to eat, drink, or visit as a tourist and finding it hard to choose amongst the variety of locations on offer. I initially decided to do some prototyping based on the Gowalla API to see if I could come up with a way to sort places based on popularity but the API only lets you sort by creation date or number of checkins. In my opinion, the number of people at a place does not form a recommendation - more people probably go to McDonald's than the local burger joint yet that does not necessarily make it a better choice for dinner. What I needed was a way to filter based on a recently added Gowalla feature; Highlights (from which the name of the app descends). At the time there was no API call to do this (e.g. searching for the "steak" highlight in Austin) so I <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/a67d3106e4a95976">posted a request on the Gowalla developer boards</a> - The feature was added as part of the "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/c7fcf5d9701b088f/e67f9bbc28244a8e?lnk=gst&q=advanced#e67f9bbc28244a8e">advanced spot search API</a>" by Andrew Dupont just under a month later.</p>

<p>Whilst toying with the idea of searching by Highlights, I realised that there was a big problem with the way I was going to approach recommendations - whilst Highlights were a definitive recommendation, there just weren't enough of them being created to power an app of the scale I imagined. It would work great in places where Gowalla use is pervasive (e.g. Austin) but even in a capital city like London searching by Highlights just doesn't return enough places. What I needed was a way to give a location a score based on a number of criteria such as number of users, highlights, comments, photos, artwork, etc - basically all the data that was available for a spot. The only way that was going to happen was with a huge API change from Gowalla or if I could somehow get a hold of all the data they had...</p>

<h2>PubSubHubbub to the rescue</h2>

<p>Back in 2010, <a href="http://hub.gowalla.com/">Gowalla launched a PubSubHubbub hub</a> powered by <a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> that allowed for realtime notifications of checkins either by user or spot. Whereas before you'd have to subscribe to an RSS feed and check it every so often for updates, PubSubHubbub allows for you to subscribe to that feed and have them push the data to you as soon as an update is available. It's very similar to the difference between checking mail on your iPhone manually or having it pushed to you automatically.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working on some funky Gowalla item stuff and so I wanted to use realtime notifications so that I could track items around the world. The biggest issue was that I'd need to manually subscribe to each feed which was tricky as there were around 3 million to follow at the time (it would have taken a month for all the subscriptions to go through if I looped through them one at a time and that doesn't include the work to follow new spots as they're created). I had been chatting to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/julien51">Julien Genestoux</a> (CEO and Founder of Superfeedr)  about getting access to the <a href="http://superfeedr.com/documentation#track">Track API</a> which gets around that problem by letting you subscribe to feeds in a much more powerful way (e.g. by keyword, location, or hub). With access to Track, I'd be able to subscribe to every notification, in realtime, that Gowalla pushed out.</p>

<p>It was whilst chatting to Julien after SXSW that I realised that PubSubHubbub could solve my problems. By using the Track API, my server would be hit with data every time somebody checked in anywhere in the world with Gowalla. I could save that information each time and basically build up my own version of Gowalla's database that I could search with a custom ranking engine. With the theory solved, it was time to get practical and put everything to the test.</p>

<h2>The Walrus and The Carpenter</h2>

<p>After a few nights I was able to put my first test version together codenamed "The Walrus" (purely because it uses feeds and I like the way the oysters say "feed" during the story of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nql1_RKwQt0">The Walrus and The Carpenter</a>" in Alice in Wonderland). Its task would be to get the spot information from the data Superfeedr were sending and work out if it was a spot I wanted to keep - I automatically remove a lot of nonsense spots (e.g. Airport Gates, Houses, McDonalds) so there was no sense saving what wasn't needed. Only a certain amount of data is sent through such as the name and location of the spot and some of its imagery, but I would need a lot more than that so when a spot was saved to the database for the first time, a note was placed on it to tell me to go and get more information.</p>

<p>At the same time as The Walrus was churning through the data was being sent, a script on the server (codenamed "The Carpenter") would run once a minute and look through the database for any spots with missing data. When it found one, it would go to the Gowalla API and the Foursquare API and get all of the data it needed and then update its record before marking it as suitable for use within the Highlights app.</p>

<p>It took a few revisions (and a massive server upgrade) until everything was running smoothly but it enabled me to process the thousands of checkins that occur every day in realtime. With thousands of checkins coming in every day, I was ready to write an algorithm that would let me search spots based on popularity.</p>

<h2>Search by recommendations: Attempt 2</h2>

<p>Whilst I originally started by ranking based on checkins and highlights, I was able to do much more than that with the huge dataset I'd amassed. Every spot is now searched based on a huge range of standard criteria (i.e. number of photos taken at a place) as well as time sensitive information that I have such as frequency between checkins and times of day. This means that a new spot in the area can still be ranked higher than an old place with a huge number of visitors as I can see that it is gaining traction faster and will overtake it at some point in the future.</p>

<p>It wasn't until June 2011 when the first version of the app was in beta and I was visiting my parents in Devon that I realised a second big problem. Places with few active Gowalla or Foursquare users were showing very few spots. This wasn't because of a lack of places or data, but just because nobody had checked in anywhere in the last month meant that no alert for me to get the spot data had been sent to "The Carpenter" script. Essentially, whilst my dataset was vast and comprised of millions of active spots, it wasn't showing those niche places (which are often better) that don't get checked into as often. Of course, these places would get added the next time someone checked in but I didn't want to have gaps when the app launched.</p>

<p>To fix this oversight, if the app finds less than 50 results in the area, it will go and do a manual check with Gowalla and get a basic listing of spots with the rubbish ones removed by the same filter "The Walrus" uses. It adds these to the browse page sorted by checkin but it crucially adds them as "pending" to my database so that "The Carpenter" can check them and rank them for next time. Basically, every time you browse an area, the app learns!</p>

<h2>Reviews and Photos</h2>

<p>Rather than just listing places, I wanted to show more about them when you went through to a detail page. I was able to show a map, address, telephone numbers, and various other bits but the two key areas of information come from Reviews and Photos. With Reviews, a call is made to both the Gowalla and Foursquare APIs in order to get Highlights and Tips from each service and merge them together with the most recent shown first. This gives an excellent and balanced overview of a place that I think works really well. I wanted to add Yelp recommendations as well but unfortunately their API is very poor for matching places or for pulling out recommendations (it limits you to 3 teasers) - I hope to add them in future if their API improves. With Photos, a similar system was used but this time it pulls images from Gowalla, Foursquare, and Flickr thanks to their geolocation API. This again adds a brilliantly balanced view which should always return some results.</p>


<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>My database currently has over 1 million locations in hundreds of countries with over 7 million checkins recorded, yet this increases every second of the day as people check-in around the world as well as browsing with the Highlights app. I'm constantly tinkering with the algorithm to make sure it gives the best results as well as finding ways to remove duplicate spots or rogue locations but version 1.1 of the app will make it possible to flag up any issues so they can be cleared up immediately.</p>

<p>I wrote Highlights out of a desire to find the best places and I am its biggest user as well as its creator - it has helped me find some great bars as well as finding a dinosaur-themed crazy golf course less than 5km from my house that I knew nothing about! The unique way in which it finds and sorts places means it should be able to find the best places anywhere in the world. In short, I'm confident it will help you whether you are finding places to eat on holiday or are just planning a pub-crawl at university. Give it a try and <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact">let me know</a> how you get on with it.</p>

			<p>One of the things that amazes me about the iPhone is the way in which it can be used in so many different ways thanks to the power of apps. I'm always interested to see new uses of the technology and so was particularly keen to take a look at GeoWiz which is a new app in the area of teaching. GeoWiz is an app aimed at children to help them make Geography "fascinating and interesting". It originally started as a board game elementary school project in California before becoming a "social mission software solution" app of which 50% of the apps selling price goes towards supporting schools. With some interesting features such as Game Center integration and a points system, this should be an interesting app in the new medium of digital teaching.</p>
<p>So what is it like?</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I had a subscription to an excellent magazine called "<a href="http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Wally's_World!">Wally's World</a>". It was part of the "Where's Wally" series and each issue looked at a different country and details such as culture, flags, animals, etc. It was a great way of learning as it was fun, had a few games (mainly word searches), but above all it was easily digestible knowledge. In many ways, I was hoping GeoWiz was going to be something similar with fun games and lots to learn. Unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0017.png" alt="GeoWiz" title="IMG_0017.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>Firstly, lets take a look at what GeoWiz offers. The general premise is a number of games based around memory retention of key facts around Geography, namely continents, countries, capitals, and flags. These games can either be the standard "matching certain objects under revolving tiles" genre or tapping on a country to match it to the capital listed at the bottom of the page.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0019.png" alt="Continents Memory" title="IMG_0019.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0022.png" alt="Click on the country whose capital is named at the bottom." title="IMG_0022.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>The tile game is pretty good but doesn't really help you learn anything (after all, you're matching shapes as quickly as possible, not taking them in). The flag game, on the other hand, is incredible difficult. I had no idea which country had "Brazzaville" as a capital so I just tapped each of the flags as quickly as possible until I found which one it was. There aren't any point deductions for getting answers wrong so you can win the game fairly quickly just by tapping all over the place. That's when I found an interesting bug; all of the answers are behind tiles in reverse order. If I tap on the bottom right-hand corner and then move my way right to left up the board, then that appears to be the solution almost every time as demonstrated by the screenshot below showing a perfect score in 3 seconds.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0023.png" alt="Cheating on GeoWiz" title="IMG_0023.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>So much for the gaming, how do you go about learning? Rather than details on each location in the style of an encyclopaedia, countries are just listed out with their flag, name, and capital. There are 4 screens yet each of them are the same just with a different sort order.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0029.png" alt="Learning in GeoWiz" title="IMG_0029.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>Tapping on a country gives you the same information but a bit larger. However, there are links to other services such as Wikipedia and NatGeo. Unfortunately, these are just inbuilt Safari windows that show no indication of loading and lack the controls of the native browser. It would probably have been better to have external links open in Safari or even to have an "Open in Safari" control for those that want to bookmark or have more control over the browsing experience.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0032.png" alt="Looking at a country" title="IMG_0032.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>I was willing to put the issues above aside as the app has some interesting credentials in terms of it's creation and how it is supposed to be used. For example, it contains OpenFeint and Game Center integration to keep children interested in progressing and competing with their friends. I appreciate the idea of adding integration for gaming networks and it's one of the things that persuaded me to review the app, but the implementation is lacking. There are only 3 achievements and they are all trivial to unlock, especially for the Angry Birds generation. Also, the issues with gameplay I mentioned (e.g. easy to cheat) will make a mockery of the leaderboards very quickly.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0039.png" alt="GeoWiz on Game Center" title="IMG_0039.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>Another area of interest is to use points earned in the games to get pocket money. Again though, the feature is let down by lack of basic UI work. The feature is hard to find and it isn't immediately obvious how it works or how you set it up - I only knew what it was due to a short description on the iTunes app page. I also have an issue with tying revision into pocket money as this smacks of bad parenting to me. Not being a Father, I can't really comment but I wouldn't want my children coming to me with an app and saying "I got 150 points so you owe me £1" especially when it is so easy to game the system. It seems to me that both parent and child would be better served by reading through a child's atlas together and keeping rewards for when they've actually passed a test or school or gained a good grade, not for when they've done a bit of revision.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0035.png" alt="Points in GeoWiz" title="IMG_0035.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0036.png" alt="Account Summary on GeoWiz" title="IMG_0036.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>The final area in the app that interested me is the promise that 50% of the app sale price goes to your child's school. It turns out that you need to find the button to do this (which isn't obvious) and then choose from a prefilled list of US schools. Whilst I appreciate the intention, it seems a little pointless to me. I'd rather use the 50% (which is £6 or $10) on the pocket money reward or actually giving it directly to my school especially as I'm based in the UK. Also, it would make more sense in my mind for the "choose your school" screen to happen automatically the first time you open the app. That ensures that everyone who uses the app gives a donation and also makes much more sense from a users perspective.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0037.png" alt="GeoWiz Donation" title="IMG_0037.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>On the whole, I'm not terribly impressed with GeoWiz. It has good intentions but the app is severely lacking in polish or finesse. From the app side of things, it doesn't support the iPhone 4 Retina Display so looks awful on any new devices. This is unacceptable in my mind as adding retina support is trivial, especially for a new app. Aside from technical implementation, there is a distinct lack of structure to the application. The main menu can only be accessed when you first open the app and you can't go back unless you force quit from the multi-tasking tray. Whilst all of the menu options are available on every page, it's the fact that you can't go back to a page you've previously seen that doesn't sit well. Add to this the lack of the regular status bar so you can't see battery life, network activity, or the time (all important things), poorly laid out navigation controls, and lack of instruction on complex features like points rewards and I can see both children and parents getting frustrated quickly. Yes the games are fun (for a time) but the poor build quality means they are easily cheated.</p>

<p>In short, your child is unlikely to gain much from this app. Geography is not simply knowing what the capital of the Congo is and identifying it's flag. It's about culture, the uniqueness of a place, and what we can learn from it. If I had £11.99/$19.99 to spend on teaching my child geography, I'd invest in either a child edition atlas or encyclopaedia and spend some quality time with them telling them about the world. I'm hopeful that one day someone will create an app similar to the "Wally's World" magazines of my youth as there is real potential for child and parent to learn together (especially with the iPad). However, GeoWiz is not it.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0 beta 2. If you have an app for iOS that you would like me to review, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>

			<p>When the iPad was first launched, one of its original touted features was the ability to run the majority of apps available in the app store (the only ones that wouldn't work were those requiring a camera but they should now work on the iPad 2). This was a great boon for Apple as they were able to claim that there were hundreds of thousands of apps available at launch but the implementation kinda sucked. Unless the app was a game (which tends to scale quite nicely if built using OpenGL), you'd end up with a pixelly mess. With the launch of the iPhone 4 and Retina Display level apps, I had always assumed that the iPad would get an update to allow it to run Retina Display iPhone apps at their full 960x640 resolution but nothing was forthcoming. So, has this been fixed in iOS 5?</p>
<p>In a word, no, nothing has changed at all (as of iOS 5 Beta 1 at least).</p>
<p>I had been meaning to write a post about the issue of app scaling a few months ago but what finally pushed me into action (aside from the iOS 5 beta) was an update for one of my favourite games, Peggle, which finally bring Retina Display graphics to the iPhone. It was then that I thought that perhaps Apple had finally gotten Retina Display apps working on the iPad but unfortunately it looks like that isn't going to be happening. This is a great shame as there are many brilliant iPhone games that have been optimised for the iPhone and would work brilliantly on the iPad, but the developers just haven't bothered to update them. Peggle is a good case in point so I'm going to use it as a demonstration with some screenshots I've knocked up to illustrate my point (note that you can click on the images below to see the real size versions).</p>
<p>First off, here is Peggle running on the iPhone 4 at full Retina Display resolution:</p>
<a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPHONE-RETINA-full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPHONE-RETINA.jpg" alt="iPhone 4 with Peggle on a Retina Display" title="IPHONE-RETINA.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="322" /></a>

<p>Looks pretty nice! Now let's take a look at it on the iPad 2:</p>

<a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-1x-full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-1x.jpg" alt="iPad running Peggle at 1x resolution" title="IPAD-NORMAL-1x.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="420" /></a>

<p>That is running at 480x320px black boxed in the middle of the screen. Now this doesn't look too bad as it would look exactly as the app would on a handset without a Retina Display (that is to say that there would be no pixelation at this size). Obviously it's awful from a usability point of view (why play a game using less than 25% of your screen?) but the real problem comes when we tap 2x to scale it up to almost full size on the iPad:</p>

<a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-2x-full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-2x.jpg" alt="iPad running Peggle at 2x resolution" title="IPAD-NORMAL-2x.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="420" /></a>

<p>(it probably doesn't look too bad in the thumbnail but click to see it at it's native size and you'll see the issue).</p>

<p>The problem is that rather than using the 960x640px assets that are available in the app (as they are used on the iPhone 4), the iPad instead just doubles up the 480x320px version resulting in a fairly fuzzy mess. Seeing as the assets exist in the app already, it should look something more like this:</p>

<a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-WITH-RETINA-full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-WITH-RETINA.jpg" alt="Mockup showing an iPad running Peggle at iPhone 4 Retina Display resolution" title="IPAD-WITH-RETINA.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="420" /></a>

<p>The iPad (both the original and the iPad 2) are more than powerful enough to cope with it so it can't be an issue of hardware specs. The only technical problem I could see would be what happens when you scale between 1x and 2x modes (as it would be difficult to have it dynamically switch between the two resolutions). However, my solution would be that if you are running an app updated to Retina Display quality, it should always run at the full size removing the need for the button.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the real problem is that Apple don't want iPhone apps to look good on the iPad. If games like Peggle worked on the iPad at pretty much native resolution, then there would be no incentive for iOS developers to develop solely for the iPad. This isn't a problem so much for games (aside from losing revenue for games that have "HD" added on the end... I'm looking at you Angry Birds) but it might be for apps like Facebook (not that they've bothered making an iPad app anyway). If normal utilities worked at double-resolution, the main argument for developing apps on the iPad would be for UI reasons, and not all iOS developers care about that (though they should).</p>

<p>Looks like the iPad is forever going to be limited to running iPhone apps at a scaled resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Update - 22nd June 2011:</strong> Ben Wetzel emailed me to let me know about <a href="http://rpetri.ch/cydia/retinapad/">RetinaPad</a>, an app for jailbroken iPads that allows you to run Retina Display iPhone apps at full resolution - it will also scale up common components and text for non-Retina Display apps.</p>

			<time datetime="2011-06-09" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/06/09/airplay-mirroring-tv-out-and-the-apple-tv-as-a-games-console/">June 09, 2011</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p>In my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/08/wwdc-2011-keynote-predictions-vs-reality/">article yesterday following up on the WWDC keynote</a>, I mentioned that I'd be looking more deeply at the AirPlay Mirroring mode in iOS 5 as it holds a number of interesting surprises. Whilst the ability to mirror the content of the iPad 2 wirelessly to the Apple TV is still impressive, the fact that developers can utilise the existing TV-Out functionality to use the Apple TV as a secondary screen is much more exciting.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24892773" width="600" height="330" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Before I look into that, let me go over a brief introduction of what AirPlay Mirroring is and how it works. At the moment, it is only supported on the iPad 2 due to it's superior CPU (the A5 chip which is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/09/ios-5-opens-door-to-true-1080p-apple-tv/">widely rumoured</a> to be making an appearance in the next iPhone and next Apple TV allowing for full 1080p resolution... at last). To enable it, all you need to do is go to the usual AirPlay icon hidden in the multi-tasking tray and you'll find a new option that allows you to enable mirroring mode.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IMG_0002.png" alt="AirPlay Mirroring on iOS 5" title="IMG_0002.PNG" border="0" width="600" height="450" />

<p>As soon as this is enabled, anything that is displayed on the iPad is instantly displayed on the Apple TV as well. If you rotate the device, the screen rotates on your television as well and it works with every app. If, like me, you've been waiting for the BBC to update their iPlayer app to work with AirPlay, you need wait no longer - the mirroring feature works with every single app (with no way of stopping it) as it is baked into the OS so you can stream content from any app to your television.</p>

<p>However, whilst that is impressive, my later discovery has much more potential.  Every since the Apple TV was announced, blogs and forums have been full of people saying "we want apps for the Apple TV". I have always felt this to be a bad move as a) there is limited space on the Apple TV and b) they would suck. Why, you ask? Well, the Apple TV only comes with a standard Apple Remote with it's 4 directional buttons, and the "play" and "menu" buttons. This might be good enough for basic browsing through a filesystem (although text entry is a pain) but it's not conjusive to the sort of experience iOS users have come to expect from their apps. I have always maintained that the best option would be to allow anybody with an iOS device to transmit apps to the Apple TV as a secondary monitor as you can then display content on the big screen and use the iPhone or iPad to control it with touch gestures.</p>

<p>Luckily, that's what Apple have done.. they just haven't told anyone.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/DSC00952.jpg" alt="AirMaps" title="DSC00952.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="450" />

<p>This is a screenshot of a test app I built for the iPhone last year called "AirMaps". Originally, I used an iPad-to-VGA adapter to plug the iPhone into my screen. The app was a simple trackpad that allowed you to manipulate Google Maps on the television. It works well enough with pinch, double-tap, etc, but having to plug in via a cable was always going to be arduous.  However, now with the AirPlay mirroring <strong>any app with TV-Out functionality will automatically broadcast it's secondary screen to the Apple TV</strong>. This is exactly what I've been talking about for the past year.</p>

<p>"Now", you might say, "that all looks rather fancy, but what are the real world implications". In a word, gaming. This feature, unmentioned though it has been, is going to bring iOS gaming to a new level. With this functionality, you can now turn the Apple TV into a games console (and a particular cheap one at that when you consider hardware and software costs).</p>

<p>By way of example, I have loaded up "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-incident/id385533456?mt=8">The Incident</a>" on my iPad 2 and iPhone. This game made some headlines a few months ago when it announced it was adding TV-Out in a rather special way. You could plug your iPad into the television with the cable, but then use WiFi on the iPhone to control the iPad app (which in turn was broadcast to the television). This was much better than the previous route but still meant you needed 2 iOS devices and a £50 cable. Now with AirPlay Mirroring on iOS 5, this functionality works out of the box without the need for the cable.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/DSC00951.jpg" alt=""The Incident" over AirPlay" title="DSC00951.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="450" />

<p>The iPad is connected wirelessly to the AppleTV thanks to AirPlay mirroring, and the iPhone is connected to the iPad over WiFi to enable it to work as a controller. Amazingly (considering it's running at 720p), the whole thing works incredibly quickly and responsively.  Obviously, this setup is rather convuluted (as you still need an iPad 2 and an iPhone) but there are other apps that will work with just an iPad 2. For example, you can now present using Keynote wirelessly (the iPad will display your presenter notes whilst the AppleTV shows the slides) but you can also play games like Real Racing 2 HD completely wirelessly using your iPad as a controller. This is truly remarkable stuff and something that I know is going to be huge once iOS 5 comes out in a few months time.</p>

<p>I put together a brief video to demo this a little better but please feel free to get in touch on <a href="http://twitter.com/bendodson">Twitter</a> or via <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">email</a> if you have any questions.</p>

			<p>I've been watching Apple keynotes with a keen interest for many, many years and I usually make a number of predictions; some correct, some completely off the mark. However, this is the first time I've decided to publish my thoughts prior to a keynote. I don't claim that all of these things will come true -- some of them are just on my wishlist -- but I will come back to this list tomorrow to see how accurate I was.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/08/wwdc-2011-keynote-predictions-vs-reality/">follow up article</a> is now available with details of the WWDC Keynote and how my predictions panned out.   
The most crucial thing about the core Apple products -- Macs, iPhones, iPads, and iPods -- is not the hardware. There are cheaper, faster components for personal computers, there are lighter more powerful smartphones, and I dare say we'll see some tablets soon which make the iPads engorged iPod Touch design feel dated. Whilst they are all aesthetically pleasing, the hardware is actually fairly underwhelming (aside from a few innovations such as the Retina Display). What makes Apple products so desirable is the software and it is for that reason that I think WWDC 2011 is going to be one of the most important conferences in recent years. With major updates for iOS and OS X at the same time, Apple has everything to gain if it gets it right, and a lot to lose if it gets it wrong. Throw into the mix a pre-announcement on cloud technology, and we could yet be surprised by what was generally perceived to be a keynote which would lack anything completely unexpected. Apple have released a press announcement and plastered the Moscone Center in posters showing that WWDC 2011 = iOS 5, Mac OS X Lion, and iCloud. For that reason, I'll take a look at each one in turn to give my predictions on what we might see announced tomorrow.</p>

<h3>iOS 5.0</h3>

<p>Definitely the highlight for me (as an iOS developer), I firmly believe that iOS 5 is going to be the biggest update to iOS since iOS 2.0 added the App Store. Why? Up until this point, iOS has been a leader in both innovation and in user experience. However, the home screens are now feeling dated and Android, Windows Phone 7, and WebOS are now creeping up in terms of features and UI (especially in the area surrounding notifications, widgets, and tiles). So, what will Apple add to iOS 5?</p>

<h4>Notifications</h4>
<p>The notifications system in the current versions of iOS is pretty shameful when stacked up against the competition. Alerts come in one at a time and overwrite previous alerts (for example, if my app sends 2 pushes, you'll only see the second one. If another app sends a push, you won't even see mine just theirs). The advent of local notifications, push notifications, and badge icons worked well as a stopgap for true multitasking, but the horrible modal UI just doesn't feel right on a phone anymore when consumers are getting more used to seeing unobtrusive notifications. When you start getting issues such as a push notification overlaying the phone panel (so you have to close a push before you can hang up on someone), the system is obviously broken. I expect this will be one of the major tentpoles of iOS 5 and we'll see a notifications system more similar to a cross between Android and Growl. On Android, you can pull down the status bar to see a list of all notifications and every app that has an unread notification is visible in the status bar as a small icon. There are notifications for new emails, tethering, available wi-fi hotspots, and 3rd party apps (e.g. new tweets). However, they are totally unobtrusive. </p>

<p>I don't think this will be copied verbatim as the UI convention doesn't work (how many users know to pull down the status bar?). What I think more likely is that the search dialogue (swipe to the right from the first home screen) will be replaced with search and notifications. At the moment, the keyboard slides up automatically to take up half the screen and the search box takes up about 50px at the top. If the keyboard didn't come up, there would be a large amount of space to list notifications in a similar way to search results (e.g. by app with a badge or other count to show notification titles) with one-touch access to the application in question.</p>

<p>But how do you know when you have notifications? I would guess that there will be an Android-similar status bar icon but that there will also be Growl-style notifications in-app. These are already used for Game Center (ever noticed when you start up a Game Center enabled app that you'll get a dialogue slide in from the top saying "Welcome back, username"?) so it's not a stretch to expect that they would be available, and tappable, for 3rd party notifications.</p>

<h4>Home Screens / Widgets</h4>
<p>The home screens have been the same on iOS since version 1.0 and are now feeling slightly dated, especially when you consider the number of apps available on the App Store. iOS 4 saw the introduction of folders and 11 screens worth of apps (meaning you can install over 2000 apps) but this still seems a way of adding more rather than making it easy to prioritise. I love the folders system, but there are other players now who are doing this better. Ashamedly, Microsoft are one of them with their tiles system which is integral to both Windows Phone 7 and the recently previewed Windows 8. It is most likely that the home screens will stay as they are but a new dashboard system (or perhaps "Mission Control" to keep in with Lion branding... see later) will be added in order to add one or two screens of your most-used apps. This might come in the form of a gesture, an app, or just being the default landing page after you unlock the phone (with another swipe necessary to take you to all apps) but I think it likely we'll see some changes to how apps can be organised. </p>

<p>This leads me nicely into Widgets which are another thing which has been popular for a while, both in OS X in the form of Dashboard, and on Android phones. On Android, some apps can drop widgets onto the home screen so you can have a space (maybe 4 app icons by 2 app icons in size) that shows you your Facebook updates or a wall clock, etc. The problems are that on Android there are no design conventions so they generally look awful - they also take up far too many system resources (e.g. the Facebook app used up 10% of my battery on average due to the way in which it checked for updates). I would expect Apple to solve both of these problems in a graceful way.</p>

<p>One last word on the home screen - I don't expect them to be gotten rid of or for widgets and apps to coincide (as on Android). The reason for this is that OS X Lion has an app overlay modelled on iOS but maintains its dashboard separately (interestingly with a swipe to the right from the apps page as per my suggestion for notifications). Whilst this <em>could</em> be an interesting tactic by Apple to lull us into a false sense of security (e.g. Lion beta has iOS home screens therefore home screens aren't changing but actually they are *dun dun daaaaaaaa*) I doubt it. I expect the home screen to remain as it is but for there to be a new dashboard screen to replace the first home screen (or some other way of accessing a widget laced dashboard).</p>

<h4>Lock Screen</h4>
<p>Heavily connected to both of the above, the lock screen needs an overhaul. A system which combines notifications and widgets would be best (so you can see, without unlocking your phone) how many emails, texts, and Twitter mentions you have as well as seeing what the weather is like in your area) but I think it's linked fairly intrinsically to the home screen system. It could be that the "Dashboard" I mention above is in fact the lock screen with home screens being unchanged but I think that would be a mistake - you can't add too much to the lock screen as the whole purpose is for it to have no touch input (incase it is activated by accident). Having a list of your notifications (so you can see if that *bing* was a notification of a baseball game starting or a new email) would be an excellent addition, but loading it up with touchable widgets would not be.</p>

<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of updates available to iOS; app updates and system updates. At present, both suck and for pretty much the same reasons. The first major problem is incremental updating. If you want to update your device or an app, you have to download a whole new version of the software (which can be hundreds of megabytes in the case of system software and games) when there may only be a handful of lines of code changed. I don't think that 3rd party apps will get the ability to do incremental updates yet (as I imagine this to be hard to implement and check for Apple and developers) but there is no reason why iOS software can't be updated in this way - OS X has been doing it for years with full combo updates available to download when things go completely wrong. The other issue (for iOS updates at least) is that you need to be tethered to iTunes. This wasn't an issue for iPods as it was generally accepted that you need to be connected to iTunes to add music so doing updates through it is logical. However, iTunes is now a bloated mess, dealing with a multitude of media and updating. It is no longer suitable for updating things like phones and post-PC devices (the iPad). iOS devices need the ability to update themselves without being linked to a computer and iOS 5 is the time to make that happen (in fact it has already been discovered that this is on the cards thanks to an over-zealous copyeditor on iTunes). The update to iOS 5 will be done in the old fashioned way but I expect that updating to iOS 5.1 (or 5.0.1) will be able to be done independently from a PC (and hopefully over a 3G connection if incremental updates are issued).</p>

<h4>Other improvements</h4>
<p>There are lots of other areas that could use improving but these are all fairly minor in comparison with the design overhauls above. Maps would do well to be updated as it pales in comparison to Android but this is largely in the hands of Google (see the problem there?) until Apple break away with their own mapping solution. I was hoping that would happen this time around but from the rumours flying around it would seem that we are going to be stuck with Google as the only built-in mapping solution for at least the next year. Game Center is another tool which needs a radical overhaul in order to make it relevant. Adding a gamification layer equivalent to Xbox Live seemed a good idea but Achievements are half-baked (you can't see a total gamerscore as per Xbox Live) and the interface is, well, horrible. Now that there are Universal apps, it would make sense for game progress to be syncable (although I'll come to this in the iCloud section below) as there is nothing more frustrating that having to play a game twice on two separate devices (or on one as if you do a restore on your phone you lose your app data). The file system is something which could do with a tweak as syncing pages documents to iOS devices is quite painful through iTunes - this is something more likely to be solved by iCloud but the actual process of accessing files on the device may well be changed. Finally, there are things like "read it later" which we already know are coming to Safari (I bet Instapaper are happy about that) as well as minor updates to each of the major apps bundled with iOS so that Steve can say "there are over 100 updates" or something similar.</p>

<p>On the whole, the main basis of iOS 5 should be about a fundamental rethink of how apps are accessed and used. Whilst apps and the home screen system were revolutionary, they are now 4 years old and showing their age - it's time for an update which allows for unobtrusive notifications, easy access to app information via widgets, and lightweight updates available everywhere. Getting FaceTime to work on 3G (as promised) would also be a nice touch seeing as Skype has been doing it for months...</p>

<h3>Lion</h3>

<p>I'm not going to say a huge amount about Lion as I think we've seen the majority of the biggest pieces in the numerous developer previews (which despite NDA have been demoed extensively on YouTube and Apple Rumour sites as well as on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">official Apple website</a>). There is obviously a huge UI overhaul with Mission Control and Launchpad as well as bring a number of other innovations from iOS (reverse scrolling, iOS scrollbars, new segmented controls, overhauled calendar interface, etc) but the most exciting things for me are Mail, Auto Save, Versions, and AirDrop.</p>

<h4>Mail</h4>

<p>The built-in Mail app has been lacking for a little while, especially now that competitors such as Sparrow are taking a lot of the limelight on the Mac App Store. With Lion, Mail is becoming more like the iPad version which for me is one of the nicest email clients around. Apple will claim "conversations" as a big step forward but the truth is that Gmail has been doing it for a very, very long time (<span style="text-decoration: line-through">10 years or so in fact</span> It was actually 7 years as Gmail started up in 2004 - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mattydsmith/status/77650864956907520">@mattydsmith</a> for the correction). However, it is a welcome improvement. I for one haven't got on well with Sparrow (bit too buggy for me at the moment) so I'm looking forward to the new version of Mail just for a few of the most basic improvements like conversations.</p>

<h4>Auto Save</h4>

<p>Just like iOS apps, Mac apps will now be built to take advantage of "auto save" - basically, whenever you change something, it is saved automatically rather than when you press the floppy disk icon (maybe this is the death of that button at last?). To be fair, this has existed for a long time in the OS itself (e.g. when you are in System Settings, you never save anything apart from when you apply network settings - everything is saved as soon as you change a toggle) and apps have faked it with autosaves (even Office does that) but this is the first time that support is baked into the OS making it a lot more efficient and reliable. A minor feature, maybe, but one that I'm sure will be welcomed by anybody that has lost data due to power failure or human error.</p>

<h4>Versions</h4>

<p>Related in many ways to Auto Save, Versions is basically Time Machine for files. Every time you alter a file, a backup is stored away somewhere so you can go back in time and get that version you wished you hadn't overwritten by accident. This has happened to be from time to time (especially when I get overzealous with my copy-paste commands and overwrite something I didn't mean to but then do something to break the "undo" button) so this will be another welcome addition. To an extent, I have this already for most of my work material as I have the packrat addition for Dropbox (which means every single file in my Dropbox is versioned automatically) but it will be nice to have the feature when I'm not connected to the internet.</p>

<h4>AirDrop</h4>

<p>A feature that hasn't been mentioned much in the press is AirDrop, a way for you to share files easily between computers. Basically, with two computers near each other, opening up AirDrop will allow you to share files without any of the usual network hoops such as Bluetooth handshakes or passwords. Whilst this could be done already if you have setup file sharing, the point is that it works out of the box. The reason I'm excited about it is because I expect it to be compatible with iOS 5 so you can very easily share files between your Mac and iPhone / iPad without a) tethering via a cable or b) iTunes. Definitely something to watch out for.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, I would expect there to be a few new headline features announced tomorrow for Lion. iWork is well overdue for an update and I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to expect iBooks to make its way to the desktop (or at least the iBooks store). Ideally I'd like to see iTunes completely rebuilt as separate apps with the Mac App Store becoming the place for Mac and iOS apps (maybe even Universal apps that run on all devices - e.g. download Twitter and it will work on iPhone, iPad, and Mac with one binary.. no reason it can't be done. I'm not saying iOS apps running on Mac OS X, just that the Mac version could be bundled so for one payment you get all 3 versions). iTunes should be an audio playback utility (and store) only with Quicktime taking over TV Shows and Movies and iBooks managing your ebooks. It astounds me that everything is still controlled from iTunes. Do I expect it to be updated tomorrow? Realistically, no. iTunes updates tend to come with iPod updates in September but I'd still hope that at some point (and Lion would be the best time to do it) that some parts of iTunes could be split out to other apps. This was one thing that iOS does very well (e.g. the iPod app doesn't control everything) so taking this "back to the mac" would make sense.</p>

<h3>iCloud</h3>

<p>This is the big unknown quantity. What is iCloud? Apple have made the unprecedented move of announcing the name (and the icon) ahead of the announcement although this was most likely to stop people wondering if the iPhone 4S (or iPhone 5) would be announced or not (hint: it won't be). Most bets are on iCloud being a storage locker for music so that you can stream your iTunes library but there are a lot better things that can be done. I've broken them down by type:</p>

<h4>Music</h4>

<p>Starting with music, it is generally accepted that iCloud is going to be heavily tied to iTunes. Music labels have apparently done deals with Apple so that streaming will be enabled but the real question is on implementation. Consensus appears to be that your iTunes purchases will be available to stream from Apple's servers to your iOS devices and Macs wherever you are. There would be no upload (as they have the master copies) and there is some advantage to this approach in that you don't need to have your iPhone synced with your 20GB library - you can just stream as and when you need it. The downside is a) you need to have purchased from iTunes (fair enough) and b) you need an internet connection. Apple tends to introduce new systems which are essentially crippled at launch and then build them up over time so I'd expect that the above is true and pretty much the extent of the music portion of iCloud. In future, we'll be able to upload our own MP3s to stream and cache things offline, etc, but for now it is most likely to be just previous iTunes purchases (although this is good news for me as I have many iTunes purchases which were lost due to a nonexistent backup strategy and now have to be re-bought as iTunes doesn't allow you to re-download music for free like it does with apps). I expect Apple to also launch a Spotify rival in the form of a monthly subscription to get streaming (and maybe offline caching) of iTunes content but this is more likely to come in September with new iPods and a new version of iTunes than at this announcement. I'll happily be wrong on that issue though as whilst I love Spotify, its library of music is nowhere near as comprehensive as Apple's.</p>

<h4>Files</h4>

<p>iDisk sucks. I don't know anybody who thinks otherwise. I also don't know anybody who uses a Mac who doesn't use Dropbox. This is a problem for Apple and one it needs to sort out fast. With their fancy new data centre and OS X Lion, there is no reason why they can't rule the online file storage space (especially if they tie it in with Versions and Time Machine along with fancy new routers to do the whole thing without your Mac being on). For this to work, there is one key requirement - uploading must be fast and easy (iDisk seems to take an age) and files need to be accessible everywhere (by which I mean, on iOS). That's pretty much it, nothing revolutionary. The keynote part of this will probably revolve around new Time Capsules and Airport Extremes which allow for your mac to sync incredibly quickly with their internal hard drives and then for the router to sync with the cloud whilst your computer is off. This is better for the environment and uses less resources on the Mac (as Dropbox hogs all memory and CPU cycles if you have a lot of updates to do) but I expect it to be an optional extra - obviously you'll be able to use file sharing on iCloud without an Apple router, it'll just be better if you have one.</p>

<h4>Apps</h4>

<p>The best thing that iCloud could do would be to open itself up as a 3rd party API. This would allow app developers who don't have access to servers and web technology (which is a lot of them bearing in mind most come from software development backgrounds, not web development like me) to sync their data between their own apps with minimal hassle. A good example of this is Things, a to-do list app by Cultured Code. It's a fantastic app but its main failing is that there is not yet a public way for you to sync content over the internet between iOS apps (e.g. iPad and iPhone) or to the Mac (e.g. iPhone to Mac or Mac to Mac). It can be done with WiFi and they are working on cloud-sync solutions, but with a 3rd party API this would have been done already. Another good example is games like Angry Birds in which you lose your progress if you wipe your iPhone or switch to your iPad (or upgrade from an iPhone 3GS to an iPhone 4). With a 3rd party API, developers could sync game save data to the cloud ready for it be downloaded on all of your devices so you never again lose your high scores. Developers win as their apps become more intuitive and cohesive and consumers win as they now have an ecosystem for their devices which maintains their data without them thinking about it. If anything, I would say that this is the biggest potential area for iCloud and I really hope to see this announced tomorrow.</p>

<h4>MobileMe</h4>

<p>The final area of iCloud is the takeover of MobileMe. I think it's fairly safe to say that MobileMe won't exist after tomorrow and will be absorbed by iCloud. However, there are updates that need to happen. At £59 a year, it's overpriced for a system which most people only use to sync their address books and calendars. Free email has been around for years (with Gmail having a superior offering), Flickr is better than the photo syncing and Dropbox is better than iDisk - the only thing worth having (aside from contact / iCal sync) is Find My iPhone which was recently made free for new iOS devices anyway. I won't speculate on pricing for iCloud (as we don't know what it is yet) but I'd expect that the syncing aspects will be free for anyone with OS X Lion or iOS devices in future (and just a nominal fee, around the $30 mark, for everyone else). The cost advantage of having syncing between all devices will net Apple more profit (just from apps and devices) than charging for that syncing service.</p>

<h3>One More Thing...</h3>

<p>There is one other thing that I've been predicting for a while and I'm hopeful we'll see a push in the right direction tomorrow; Apple TV Apps. When I say apps, I don't mean native apps on the Apple TV. That won't work for the simple reason that the Apple TV only comes bundled with a basic remote which provides very little control for things more advanced than the YouTube app that comes bundled (and that's bad enough when it comes to text entry). No, what I mean is that iOS 5 apps on iPhone and iPad should be allowed to use the Apple TV as a secondary screen. APIs exist for this (in a way) with a cable in that an iPad-to-VGA adapter can let you display your apps on a secondary monitor (e.g. using the Keynote app you can display your presentation on a projector and notes on your iPad) and the iPad 2 introduced mirroring mode allowing you to play games at HD resolution on your TV with the component cable. However, I want to be able to play something like Real Racing wirelessly with my iPhone providing the app and acting as a wireless steering wheel, yet transmitting the data to the TV so that the Apple TV can display the game. There are issues to solve with lag (especially in HD gaming) but these could be solved by having an app payload sent over to the TV and cached locally as part of an initial load (kind of like buffering a movie) and then the remote only sending light data packets with control information. As an example, use the Apple Remote app with an Apple TV and you'll find it highly responsive - you can scroll and tap on the iPhone to control the Apple TV and it all works in real time. Just imagine if you could transmit your Keynote presentation wirelessly and then control it in the same way or play Angry Birds on the big screen. Throw in a built-in version of Game Center and suddenly Apple will be up against the entrenched console systems in the living room - you wouldn't even need to change the name AirPlay as the "play" could be about gaming rather than just AV playback. I've been talking about this ever since the iPad was launched but I think now is the time it could become a reality - it's a long shot but we'll see tomorrow!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In conclusion, tomorrow could be one of the many defining moments in Apple's history. If iOS 5 gets enough of a redesign to keep it fresh when compared to the newcomers, if OS X Lion launches soon with more upgrades than those previewed, and if iCloud introduces true syncing between them, then it will set the tone for Apple for the next 5 years. However, if iCloud is anything like the MobileMe launch (e.g. a shambles), then things will turn out very differently.</p>

<p>I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/bendodson/">tweeting</a> any major announcements as they happen and I'll chuck up a summary post tomorrow to see how many of my predictions have come true. In the meantime, if you have any opinions, fire me a <a href="http://twitter.com/bendodson/">message on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">drop me an email</a>.</p>

			<p>It's been just over a year since I started <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/">WikiLocation</a>, a simple REST-ful API to access geocoded Wikipedia articles.  During that time, hundreds of developers have made use of the API in mashups, apps, and commercial products.</p>
<p>Today, I'm happy to announce that I've added locale support to the WikiLocation API. This means that the API now provides access to over <strong>3.8 million geocoded articles across 36 different languages</strong>. The following languages are now supported via a simple "locale" parameter which can be added to any API call (full details can be found in the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/">WikiLocation API Documentation</a>):</p>

<p>In addition to these new articles and language filters, I have also updated the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/">WikiLocation.org website</a> with a new visual design which should make it easier to find critical information. Finally, the API has been relocated to a new dedicated server to provide even faster access for your applications.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback or questions relating to the API, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/">get in touch</a>.</p>

			<time datetime="2011-05-12" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/05/12/one-year-on-further-thoughts-on-the-gowalla-api/">May 12, 2011</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p>Today is the one-year anniversary of a letter I put together entitled "<a href="http://gowallatools.com/api/">Thoughts on the Gowalla API</a>", a very critical look at the ever-changing API provided for the popular location-based service.  The article was picked up on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/12/gowalla-api-problems/">TechCrunch</a> and has been <a href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/api_design_rules/">mentioned at conferences</a> and events but I also like to think that it prompted a few changes. In this post, I want to revisit some of the points I made and hopefully highlight some of the changes that have come about as well showing where further improvements could be made.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When I first put the post together, I was running a service called Gowalla Tools and coming up against constant changes to the API and a very unresponsive developer community.  I decided to put the tools and services I was building on indefinite hiatus whilst I waited for some changes to take place.  The most important of these was putting in place a process of notifying API developers when changes were going to happen rather than making them and only occasionally sending out a notification a few days later. Fortunately this is now the case and Gowalla have assembled a fantastic team of developers who are constantly available on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev">Gowalla Developers Google Group</a>. The big changes really started to happen in August 2010 when <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/post/977720465/hello-3rd-party-apps-gowalla-checks-in-with-oauth">Gowalla announced that their OAuth 2.0 implementation</a> was now complete and you could now make secure authenticated calls including the ability to check users in at a spot (something which hadn't existed up until that point).</p>

<p>Once OAuth 2.0 was introduced, I started to play around with the API again and launched a new service called <a href="http://wallab.ee/">Wallabee</a> in September.  The first application was entitled "<a href="http://wallab.ee/apps/travel-edition/">Wallabee: Travel Edition</a>" and allowed users to check-in using over 95% less data than the official app making it a) much faster and b) a lot cheaper when you are travelling overseas.  The app was a big success, frequently appearing in the "What's Hot" section of the App Store, and several of the Gowalla employees have used it whilst travelling. Over Christmas I made a number of announcements about future app plans and in March 2011 I, along with a number of contributors, launched The Wallabee Pouch. It was a new player guide, a directory of information, and home to <a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/directory/">The Item Directory</a>, the largest and most up-to-date repository of Gowalla items.  This was all made possible due to an API that no longer changed and the incredibly helpful advice provided by many of the Gowalla Developers. I'd like to personally thank <a href="http://twitter.com/amcmanus/">Adam McManus</a> who provided a lot of advice and support whilst I was working on The Item Directory, probably the biggest drain on their API at present.</p>

<p>I went to SXSW in March and was very privileged to meet the Gowalla team and spend some time chatting to their developers. I also listened to some incredibly powerful talks by <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP6984">Josh Williams</a> and <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5756">Jon Carroll</a> which made me make some fundamental changes to the way I was working with Gowalla - you can read all about that on my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/">SXSW and Gamification post</a>.  It eventually led to me handing over Wallabee to another developer so I could focus on some of my own Gowalla apps that were focussed on the story and travelling elements of the service rather than the item and game based sections, but I'll get back to this shortly.</p>

<h2>The API</h2>

<blockquote><p>We accept that changes have to happen but these just need to be conveyed to developers in a better way. We propose that any changes be submitted to the Gowalla Developer Group at least 1 week in advance of a change so that we can update our code as necessary. We also suggest that a “version” parameter be added across the API so that legacy scripts can continue to work without changes. In this way, a developer can move to the next API version to take advantage of any new features and data but won’t risk having their hard work undone by what could be a very minor change (e.g. renaming a parameter).</p></blockquote>

<p>This is probably the biggest area of improvement that the Gowalla API has undergone. This time last year, parameters were changed without consultation and code breakage was a frequent distraction. Now however, many changes are submitted to the Developer Group in advance and opinion is sought on the best ways to improve the API. This was highlighted most recently to me by Rob Mack who sent out an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/412852f04007ab4a#">incredibly detailed post about changes</a> they were going to make to the Check-In API. The changes were detailed along with a timeline of when they'd go into effect (3 weeks in future) and a promise that anybody who wouldn't be able to meet the deadline would be able to get an extension if they emailed. This was followed up weekly with reminders of the impending changes. It's this kind of conversation and service that goes beyond what I had originally suggested and makes it such a pleasure to work with the API now. There have been numerous suggestions from the community that have been added to the API in recent months and responses to bugs or questions are incredibly fast.  Whilst versioning hasn't come into effect, it hasn't really needed to as any changes have been non-destructive or have had a sensible transition period.</p>

<blockquote><p>It may also be worth setting up a dedicated Twitter account for API changes as Foursquare has done with @foursquareapi - this would allow you to make quick posts to the community about any changes or downtime.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whilst posts on the Developer Board have been greatly improved, I still believe that having a Twitter account for broadcasts about downtime or any major changes would be a good idea. I currently subscribe to the full emails of the board and so I can get an email whenever anybody posts something new - sometimes these are API developers asking basic questions yet sometimes they are important posts by the Gowalla devs that could easily get lost in the noise (especially if you have digests on). By having a feed that just posted notices from the Gowalla developers, visibility of changes would be greatly improved.</p>


<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>I originally wrote a section about cheaters purely because the option to check-in was not available in the API despite the fact it could be done easily using a JavaScript hack on the mobile site. The main reason for not having it in the API was that it would increase the ease for cheaters to make false check-ins just to collect stamps and items. Whilst the API was eventually updated to allow check-ins, the number of people cheating the system is still very high.  A lot of trips are completed by people that haven't been to the spots and increases in check-in radius (which was a sliding scale depending on spot size and is now 5km regardless) have only exacerbated the problem. A lot of Gowalla players report these users to Gowalla via GetSatisfaction or email but there isn't any visibility on action taken. There have, however, been instances where users have been suspended for checking-in too fast, oftentimes incorrectly just on the basis of community feedback.  In my letter last year, I said:</p>

<blockquote><p>With regards to cheating, it should be fairly simple to ascertain if somebody is checking-in illegally as you can measure the time and distance between two spots and see if the speed is over a certain threshold (e.g. if you have checked-in at Austin and London within 2 minutes then there is obviously a problem). An automated system could monitor such things and then suspend an account giving it limited permissions (e.g. no item trading) until a Gowalla developer (or STE member) has a chance to review the account and unlock or ban the user.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know that this is possible as I decided to build my own system to do exactly this detection in order to stop the vigilante justice that had been seen.  However, many of the cheating accounts are private and are therefore unaccessible through the API which means Gowalla needs to tackle this problem themselves. I still believe that an automated system could work and involving the STE members would allow for a certain level of visibility on solving the issue.</p>

<p>These issues are particularly troubling at the moment due to the launch of Gowalla Rewards, the ability to pick up items at certain locations which have some form of real world reward attached to them. This issue has been solved slightly by <a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/tips/">a policy Gowalla put in place</a> which basically limits how many items you receive based on the number of check-ins you make - whilst a good system, it did essentially pitch those players who like items against those that like the stamps and trips (again read my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/">post on gamification</a> for more details on this) and it wasn't relayed to the community very well at all.  There is still a lot of work to be done in this area in my opinion.</p>


<h2>Publicising</h2>

<p>One of other items I suggested was:</p>

<blockquote><p>Creating a directory of applications that use the API (such as Foursquare has)</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, this is something that hasn't happened yet but there have been some very small moves to publicise things that have been made with the Gowalla API.  On the post announcing OAuth integration, a couple of projects that used the API were mentioned and on the official Gowalla twitter feed, a couple of web apps have been mentioned (they both did the same thing about 4 months apart, but still).  However, making brief reference to 4 apps over the course of a year doesn't really promote all of the cool things that people are making. It also doesn't encourage other developers to get involved as, without promotion by Gowalla, the API feels a little like an afterthought which is a shame given the huge amount of improvement that has been made.</p>

<p>A page highlighting some of the applications made using the API would enable new developers to see a benefit to writing apps for the service - it also enables developers to get their app across to the core audience (as most apps developed are going to be targeting users already on the Gowalla service). I'm hopeful that the Gowalla twitter account will be posting out a few more of the great 3rd party apps that people have made over the coming months.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>One of the final criticisms I had was in the documentation of the API as it was particularly sparse.  Most of the comments on the Developer Boards were about errors being returned that weren't documented anywhere or about nuances in the API calls (e.g. why can't I check-in at the same place twice within an hour?) - However, the documentation has improved dramatically over the last few months with the Gowalla team listening to feedback from developers and patching up the docs or adding new pages as requested. A particularly difficult area was the new <a href="http://hub.gowalla.com/">PubSubHubbub</a> feature (which should really be publicised more - it's amazing) yet <a href="http://gowalla.com/api/docs/pshb">documentation was put up within a few days</a> of a request on the boards.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Overall, the Gowalla API has improved dramatically in the past year. With a solid foundation and regular updates from developers, there is now very little risk to basing an app on the API as opposed to last year when maintenance was taking longer than development.  There are still a few areas which could use improvement, particularly around publicising of 3rd party endeavours and communicating better around misdemeanours, but on the whole I can wholeheartedly recommend the API to any developer interested in location based services. There have been a lot of new API calls created and I get the feeling that there is some very exciting stuff around the corner. I would also recommend looking into the <a href="http://hub.gowalla.com/">PubSubHubbub</a> functionality as this puts Gowalla way ahead of its competitors by providing real-time notification of check-ins.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd like to thank all the developers at Gowalla who have put so much time and effort into improving the API, particularly <a href="http://twitter.com/therealadam">Adam Keys</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewdupont">Andrew Dupont</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/robmack">Rob Mack</a> who have been incredibly responsive on the Developer Boards.</p>

			<time datetime="2011-05-10" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/05/10/font-finder-now-available-for-firefox-4-and-safari-5/">May 10, 2011</a></time>

			<p>Many of you will be familiar with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/">Font Finder</a>, one of my first Firefox Extensions.  The purpose of Font Finder was to display information about the selected font within your browser including information like size, line-height, color, etc. It also went further by not only showing you the font-family stack, but also determining which one was actively being rendered on your machine (as the font you see might be different to other users depending on your installed fonts).</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that as of today, Font Finder is now available as a <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/browser-extensions/font-finder.safariextz">Safari 5 Extension</a>.  It has also been updated to be fully compatible with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/">Firefox 4</a>.  I'm not planning on building it for any other browsers (e.g. IE9, Chrome) but if you have any suggestions for improvements to either version, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>This is just the first step in porting Font Finder to Safari 5 and I will shortly be releasing an update which makes full use of the Safari UI rather than containing everything within an alert box - I will also be adding a lot more information, particularly around CSS 3.</p>

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2011/05/04/portal-2-on-the-new-imac-10-6-6/">Portal 2 on the new iMac (10.6.6)</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2011-05-04" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/05/04/portal-2-on-the-new-imac-10-6-6/">May 04, 2011</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>Today I purchased one of the brand new iMacs that were released yesterday. One of the first things I installed was Steam and Portal 2 (as I'm looking forward to playing co-operatively with a friend on Windows) but I was surprised when trying to play that it required OS X 10.6.7</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-04-at-20.24.23.png" alt="Portal 2 requires Mac OS 10.6.7" title="Screen shot 2011-05-04 at 20.24.23.png" border="0" width="420" height="122" />

<p>This is surprising because 10.6.7 has been around for a little while now so why wasn't it on the new iMacs by default.  After trying a system update, I found that there was no update for the 10.6.6 iMacs and other people had tried the Combo Update downloadable from Apple to no avail.</p>

<p>After downloading all of Portal 2, I decided not to give up easily and see if there was a way around it. Developers are generally lazy and so they are probably just checking for the string 10.6.6 in the system version.  As this version of 10.6.6 has all of the drivers for the new graphics card required for Portal 2, I thought there would probably be no harm in changing that system version to 10.6.7 to get past the Steam requirements. Turns out I was right!</p>

<p>To get your copy of Portal 2 running on your new iMac, navigate to <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/</code> - now copy the file <code>SystemVersion.plist</code> to your desktop and open it for editing. Change the references to 10.6.6 to 10.6.7 and save. Now you'll want to delete the existing version and then copy your new file in it's place - you will need admin rights to do this.</p>

<p>Once that's done, fire up Portal 2 - you may get the "System requirements failed" message but if you press "Continue anyway" then Portal 2 will load and be perfectly playable (at 1080p).</p>

<p>Now, go forth and continue testing!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when a 10.6.7 fix does come available for the new iMac, you should probably edit the <code>SystemVersion.plist</code> file and change the references back to 10.6.6 just to make sure nothing bad happens...</p>

<p><strong>[20/05/11] Update:</strong> OS X 10.6.7 is now available through System Update for the new iMacs - make sure you reverse the process above before updating.</p>

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2011/05/01/review-worldictionary-for-ios/">Review: Worldictionary for iOS</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2011-05-01" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/05/01/review-worldictionary-for-ios/">May 01, 2011</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/worldictionary-instant-translator/id429372600?mt=8">Worldictionary</a> is a translation app for iPhone that allows you to use the built-in camera to detect and translate words on the go.  The only language I understand other than English and the various programming languages I've picked up is Latin, so an app to help me understand various signs and documents in foreign countries is definitely useful for me!</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0414.png" alt="Translating from English to French" title="IMG_0414.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>When you launch the app, the camera is activated and you can instantly begin translating.  All you need to do is line up the magnifying glass with the word you want to translate and it will automatically appear at the top of the app.  The word it thinks it detects is displayed on top with the translation underneath.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0411.png" alt="Translation mistakes" title="IMG_0411.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>As you can see from the image above, the camera doesn't always detect words cleanly (more examples can be seen from the history panel in the bottom right corner) but it is very fast at detection so these issues don't interfere too much.  The app isn't designed to work with handwritten fonts but should work with anything in a regular font.  The example document I'm using is a polling card for the upcoming election referendum here in the UK.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0416.png" alt="Language selection" title="IMG_0416.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>To change the language, tap the bar at the bottom of the app which brings up a scrollable view listing an impressive number of languages to convert to and from.  These are all available by default so there is no in-app purchase for language packs as per some other translation apps.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0417.png" alt="Translating from English to German" title="IMG_0417.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>Once a new language is chosen, you can start translating instantly.  I was struck by how fast detection and subsequent translation was and I experienced no problems with the app such as crashing or memory problems.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0418.png" alt="Translation results" title="IMG_0418.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>You can tap the translated words or tap any previous translations listed on the right hand side of the app to go through to a more thorough translation detailing example usage, structure, synonyms, and definitions from the web (including services such as wikipedia and online dictionaries).</p>

<p>Whilst the translation is good and the app does what it says, I did encounter 2 problems which may stumbling points depending on your usage.</p>

<p>Firstly, the app only detects single words, not sentences or paragraphs both in camera mode and the manual input mode.  This might be fine for the odd word lookup but isn't terribly useful for something more involved such as a menu or road sign.  Also, without understanding sentences, words in some languages may not make sense (as many languages have words with different meanings depending on the surrounding words).  Whilst understanding full sentences is still difficult for translation algorithms, I do think the app would work better if it could at least do the per-word translation on an entire sentence so you don't have to slowly input each word individually.</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0424.png" alt="No translation without network access" title="IMG_0424.PNG" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

<p>The second problem is more important from my perspective but is also something that is unlikely to be fixed; you need to have internet access in order to perform translations. This is because the translation engine being used is Google Translate and therefore doesn't have offline access.  The reason this causes problems is that many people travel abroad where data roaming charges are still completely excessive (I was charged £6 per MB whilst I was in the US recently) and therefore switch their data roaming off.  The benefit of a translation app is that you can use it anywhere when you need it (e.g. translating a menu at a restaurant) and you may not have WiFi available - turning on the data roaming for translation could become an expensive habit, particularly if you haven't turned off other apps or push notifications before making the switch.  Whilst the API calls the app makes should be fairly small, I'd be more worried about forgetting to turn off data roaming after I'd used the app.</p>

<p>Whilst these problems are present in other apps, there are some which manage to solve both of these such as <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8">Word Lens</a> which gained a lot of publicity when it first launched due to the clever way in which it uses the camera not only to translate, but also to place the translated words back into the original camera image.  It might be a more expense app with translation packs at £5.99 each, but it works offline and can translate whole sentences (in a very cool way).  Unfortunately, Word Lens only works with English and Spanish translations so is not terribly useful if you are going to France or Germany for instance.</p>

<p>Worldictionary is a clever app with its word recognition and fast translations (depending on network speed) but its lack of sentence recognition and reliance on internet connectivity lets it down.  If you can look past these issues, then I can recommend it as a good translation tool for those times when you need a rough translation or have a need for multiple languages.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/worldictionary-instant-translator/id429372600?mt=8">Worldictionary</a> is priced at £2.99/$4.99 as is available in the App Store.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on an iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.2.  If you have an app for iOS that you would like me to review, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>

			<time datetime="2011-04-13" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/04/13/itunes-tv-artwork-script/">April 13, 2011</a></time>

			<p>I have a large amount of TV shows stored in iTunes but not all of them were purchased there, particularly as you can buy a Blu-Ray of many TV shows for a fraction of the price of a Standard Definition download. The only issue I've had is that I lacked artwork for each of these shows. In the past, I'd just screenshot the 200px or so image that showed up in the iTunes store and use that, but since getting an Apple TV (which displays the artwork at a much larger size) I decided I needed a better solution. After a weekend of sorting out my iTunes library, I decided to take a look at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html">iTunes Search API</a> and see if I couldn't find a way of getting that artwork. They provide a 100x100px thumbnail as part of the API response, but fortunately (with some URL experimentation) I found a way to get the full 600x600px artwork.   
You can <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-tv-artwork/">find the working version on my projects page</a> but I thought I'd share the code briefly below so you can see how it's done and adjust it for any other media available on iTunes (e.g. movies, music, apps).</p>

</pre>

<p>As you can see, it makes a fairly standard API call to the US iTunes store (as that has far more content than any of the others) which returns a lot of information about the particular entity (in this case a TV series).  However, the artwork URL provided is only good for a 100x100px image so I us  a basic <code>str_replace</code> to change that to 600x600 (the only other size I've found that works is 200x200).  Once that's done, I grab the title and stick it all in an array to loop through later - simple!</p>
<p>Hopefully this script will be of some use to you - it's certainly made my library look a lot nicer when browsing on an iPad or an Apple TV!</p>

			<p>Since childhood, I’ve been a huge fan of maps and the concept of location. I used to spend hours drawing maps of the neighborhood where I lived and reading books and magazines about different countries and places around the world. Much later, I became a web developer and would spend a lot of time playing with the Google Maps APIs and creating mashups with the FireEagle service.  When the iPhone came out, I was hooked; not only for the simplistic UI (I could write an entire blog on how less is more with UI) but by the fact that your location was always in the palm of your hand.  Once the iPhone SDK came out, I switched careers purely because location-based apps were the stuff of my dreams and that’s what I wanted to spend my time on.   
Earlier this month, I headed to Austin for my first experience of SXSW.  Whilst many people (myself included) went for the talks and networking opportunities, I was mainly interested in meeting the people behind Gowalla, a location-based service I’ve spent a lot of time with over the past 3 years.  In Austin, I was staying with a group of friends who had come not for SXSW, but to collect the rare items and pins that would be available through Gowalla.</p>

<p>The purpose of this blog post is to explain what I’ve learned about the future of location-based services both from talking to Gowalla employees, and watching how people play Gowalla in the real world.</p>

<h3>Gamification and Social Validation</h3>

<p>One of the key buzzwords of SXSW 2011 was “gamification” which is loosely defined as:</p>

<blockquote><p>The use of game play mechanics for non-game applications, particularly consumer-oriented web and mobile sites, in order to encourage people to adopt the applications</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same way that apps add “tweet this” and “facebook that” buttons in order to tick the box for social media, it seems that the future is based around the idea of adding a game layer purely because other apps have one.  These mechanics tend to be of the badge variety which works by giving the user digital badges for reaching certain goals.  Some go further by giving you physical things (e.g. stickers) rather than digital items.</p>

<p>In addition to gamification, there is also the proliferation of the “check in” model of thinking.  This is the idea that you can now check in to anything be it a location (Gowalla, Foursquare), TV shows (Miso, Glue), Books (GoodReads), or just about anything else you can think of.  When the models are combined with social networks like Twitter of Facebook, it seems that most applications are generally designed to do 2 things; either tell people what you are doing or show-off to other people about how good you are at a digital task.</p>

<p>For me, the best talk at SXSW was by<a href="http://twitter.com/jw"> Josh Williams</a>, CEO of <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, in which he discussed the future of location-based services in a talk entitled “<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/firewheel/where-are-we-going-sxsw-2011">Where are we going</a>”.  The candid presentation talked a lot about where services had gone wrong but was also self-admittedly contradictory (especially when you look at the Gowalla service overall which I’ll come onto later).  However, he had one key slide which I think resonated with everybody in the room:</p>



<blockquote><p>Social validation is the primary driver for activity on today’s web</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a profound idea that suggests the reason that people play with game layers, send tweets, check in on apps, and use social networks and services is purely based on egotism; we do things not because we want to, but because we want to be accepted by society. This is not a new idea, but it is one that I think a lot of people have been blind to for a long time.  With one sentence, Williams had made me uninstall a number of apps on my phone and take a fundamental look at the projects I was working on and the people I was interacting with.</p>

<p>Another key quote from the talk was:</p>



<blockquote><p>Game mechanics are subservient to the usefulness of a service</p></blockquote>



<p>Whilst this one didn’t hit me with as much impact as the piece on social validation, it’s something I’ve not been able to stop thinking about over the past few weeks. Social validation is the main reason people use a game mechanic but what is the driver for playing a regular game, watching TV, or reading a book? After thinking on it, I’ve concluded that the driver for offline tasks tends to be story, whilst online we tend to want to  share our story.  By way of example, I might watch Mad Men as I enjoy the plot, but I’ll tweet about it because I want social validation.</p>

<p>This describes the correlation between offline and social networking well enough, but what about game mechanics? These were created in order to incentivise a story action but tend more often to promote the idea of social validation.  An interesting game mechanic to look at would be something like Xbox Achievements or PS3 trophies. These were designed to extend the life of a game by adding extra challenges that weren’t part of the main storyline yet have now evolved into an exercise in social validation.  People will now play games not because they are interested in the game itself but because they want a higher gamerscore. I’ve seen (and been a part of) this idea myself and it’s only when I think about it that I realise that the best games I’ve played are generally the ones which don’t have achievements. Games like Zelda and Final Fantasy are good because of the story and core mechanic, not because they improve my gamerscore.  I’m not saying that all achievements are bad, but I do feel that a game like Assassins Creed II is detracted from when players are performing tasks such as collecting 100 feathers for the sole reason of improving their gamerscore.</p>

<p>Whilst console games can have both this social validation aspect and a good storyline, a worrying trend with most new game mechanics and online games is that they don’t have the story portion at all.  For instance, what is the point of Farmville?  There is no ending, there is storyline, it is simply a game based around social validation.  So it is for services like PackRat (made by the same people as Gowalla) in which you can collect items simply for the purpose of showing other people.  Both these games (and others) have an element of a game currency (for purchases of items in the game world) which can be topped up with real money.  You therefore end up actually paying real money to purchase items in a digital world for the sole purpose of showing them off to other people.  I eventually stopped playing PackRat when I came to the realisation that I was spending money and time (sometimes jumping up when new items came out so I could be the first to get one) on a service which actually had no benefit.  I maintain that the reason for this is that there is no ending - users might spend time collecting all the Pokémon on a Nintendo DS as they know there is an ending, but with Farmville, PackRat, et al., the whole thing is continual.</p>

<h3>Gowalla: A game of two halves</h3>

<p>So, what of location-based services?  Gowalla has a difficult task ahead of it currently as it is walking a line of two different concepts; the idea of exploring the world and the idea of collecting items.  I believe these can be defined as story and social validation respectively. </p>

<p>Gowalla have used variations of “explore the world” since they first started and it is one of the key things that drew me to them.  With their beautiful artwork, it was easy to imagine that your travels were like those in the past where travelers would place a sticker on their suitcase from each place they visited.  The concept of a digital passport imitating the real world was exciting and they have done a great job of extending this with featured spots and trips.  More recently, highlights and notes have allowed users to show where there favorite places are both publicly and privately and encourage other people to visit those locations.  One of the most interesting pieces they are working on is in telling the “story” of your travels.  This has begun with them joining your flights together and showing the distance (and connecting flights if applicable) when you check-in at 2 or more airports in a row.  They used this feature to award a special pin for those that had travelled to SXSW when they landed back at their originating airport (so I got mine at Heathrow after travelling back from Austin airport).  Williams has been mentioning for a long time that these flight updates are “just the beginning” and I can envisage a future in which they can build up a digital holiday keepsake for you (complete with photos, highlights, check-ins, and tweets) by using this information.</p>

<p>However, the other side of Gowalla is one based on a game layer.  Items have long been a sore point to many users (including myself for a time) as they were one of the key features that differentiated Gowalla from other location based services (such as Foursquare).  As most new users were coming from PackRat, it is easy to see why items were such a key part to many peoples experience.  However, like the never-ending gamification I described earlier, there is no ending for items.  Once you have them all, you don’t get anything as a new one might be released next week.  Therefore there is no end and no purpose to collecting them other than to show off to other people for social validation.</p>

<p>Gowalla have been slowly trying to lessen the importance of items within the game in order to focus on story, but as they have done so the community has been more and more vocal about the changes.  One of the changes was to make it so that checking in to more than 5 places within an hour would trigger a switch preventing you from receiving items for the next 24 hours.  This was at odds with the “collect them all” aspect of items which require checking in all over the place in order to get them but was done in the interest of making people check-in where they are right now rather than checking-in everywhere within 5km (the current distance you are allowed to check-in from your actual location) just to get items.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was privy to many embarrasing moments at SXSW where the Gowalla team were subjected to people complaining about items, check-ins, and the other aspects that I’m sure Gowalla don’t really care about (as they don’t build on the story mechanic).  I saw some of the most childish outbursts I’ve ever seen in my life over something as simple as a digital item and it really put me off items as a whole.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Gowalla need to cut items lose in order to really grow as a service.  Judging by the complaints on their GetSatisfaction pages, I’d say that the vast majority of complaints are about the game mechanic rather than the overall service and its story elements.  If they were to cut off the game mechanic, Gowalla would lose a lot of users, but they’d be able to focus on the key part of the service; “seeing the world”.  This in turn would build a better product and allow them to regain users who share their vision rather than trying to maintain the careful balance they have at present.</p>

<p>My current belief is that items are slowly being fashioned into rewards, a feature that was launched at SXSW.  With rewards, some of the digital items you find are actually usable as promotional offers (so you might get a “free taco” item which allows you get a free taco when you check-in at certain locations).  If they removed the non-reward items, they could have a social layer which has a purpose and isn’t tied so intrinsically with the limitations of exploration.  By that, I mean that people would be encouraged to check-in only where they are currently, and by doing so they may receive one of these promotional rewards.  Once a reward is used, it should then be archived as it then serves as a history of the promotions you’ve earned (which are a story in themselves).  By doing this, you no longer have a part of the service which encourages multiple check-ins for items which have no value beyond social validation.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this is there current plan, but it seems a sensible way forward.</p>

<h3>Wallabee: A project based on Gowalla items</h3>

<p>If you’re familiar with my projects, you’ll know of a service I created called <a href="http://wallab.ee/">Wallabee</a>.  It’s a website (and set of apps) that build on the Gowalla API and basically dishes out a lot of information about items in particular.  I originally created it as I wanted an easy way of finding out which types of spots items appeared at.  Items were a fun feature at the start of Gowalla and I would travel to whole new places just to pick up an item - I used to think I was doing this because I wanted items but I eventually realised that I was enjoying having a reason to go to new places and “see the world”. Once I made the site public, it gathered a large following and has grown into various things since.  There are apps, item hunters, tools to show Flickr photos at different spots, and a new guide which introduces players to key Gowalla concepts (as Gowalla itself has no tutorial).  However, the most popular things every time have been things to do with items (which is confirmed by a new feature I built recently called the Item Directory which shows people where every item can be found in real time).</p>

<p>After SXSW and thinking on both the attitudes of people I’d seen and the talks I’d heard, as well as mulling over everything I’ve said above with regards to social validation, gamification, and the future of Gowalla, I decided that I just didn’t want to do this anymore.  I’ve been working on Wallabee in its various incarnations for two and a half years and it wasn’t until I took a step back that I realised everything I was doing was based on items.  I’m not interested in Gowalla items. I haven’t even been actively trying  to collect them myself for the past year (yet I seem to have got them all just because of my slow check-in rate) so why am I building free apps based around them? I realised that I was doing it not because I wanted to, but because it was what most of the followers I’d gained (by starting with item-based tools) were asking for.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore decided to stop working on Wallabee and instead focus on building location-based apps that extend the story aspects of travel rather than the gamification aspects.  If you’re a Wallabee user, then you’ll want to<a href="http://wallab.ee/pouch/2011/03/27/moving-on-from-wallabee/"> read my post on the Wallabee site about how this affects you</a>, but basically I’m handing the site over to another developer who is interested in the gamification layer and in building upon the brand I’ve created.</p>

<p>I will still be using the Gowalla API and the Gowalla service as I think it shows great potential and is a genuinely exciting location-based service.  I’ll be doing this under my own name rather than the Wallabee brand, however, and the apps will mostly be of a paid nature.  This begins soon with a completely new app which I’ll be releasing shortly.</p>

<h3>To the future</h3>

<p>This blog post ended up being about five times longer than I intended but I hope it gives you an insight into what I think about location-based services moving forward as well as some of the social issues around game mechanics.  To finish, I’d like to take one more quote from Josh Williams talk at SXSW:</p>

<blockquote><p>Stay true to your vision</p></blockquote>

<p>I lost track of my vision when I started developing tools that I wasn’t using myself.  I’m looking forward to returning to my vision by creating new apps that will help people explore the world around them.</p>

    	<div>
			<p>Over the last couple of months, I've been using two competing phones day-today; a Nexus S (Android) and an iPhone 4 (iOS).  Whilst there are many differences and similarities, one of the things I want to talk about today is the different ways in which they deal with updates to the core operating system.  System updates are a crucial part of the mobile experience - sometimes they offer major new features but they are usually minor updates to deal with bug fixes.  So how do Apple and Google deliver their system updates?</p>
<h3>Android</h3>

<p>The Android platform updates itself via an "over-the-air" system which appears to rely on individual carriers to push out system updates.  Due to the large number of different devices, certain updates will only appear for certain phones and this fragments further by region and carrier.  For example, Android 2.3.3 came out 2 days ago and only runs on the Nexus S at present - whilst a number of customers in the US have received the update, my Nexus S is still refusing to detect an update from 2.3.2 leaving me to conclude that it is waiting for my carrier to push it out.  However, when an update does appear, the process is very slick.  A notification appears to let you know you have an update including details of what this adds and the size (which for minor updates tends to be a couple of MB).  One tap starts the download process and, once complete, the phone reboots and you're up and running.  At no point do you need to plug into a computer or even connect to a wireless network. It's very impressive.  However, the lack of cohesive strategy on when updates will appear and on what devices they will work on causes the whole process to be a bit of a disappointment, especially when you're waiting on a major bug fix or new feature.</p>

<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>The iOS update system is very different.  Each update requires you to plug your iPhone into iTunes where an update will then download and sync to the phone.  Each update includes the entire OS, rather than an incremental update, so is typically around 450MB (depending on device).  This takes a long time to download but then takes about the same time again to install onto the device.  The advantage to this process is that if something goes wrong you can restore from a backup immediately (whereas on an Android phone in the wild you'd be stuck without a phone).  Also, when an update is available, it is generally available globally within 2 hours of release and there is a button you can press to check for updates manually.  Apple also post a direct download link on their support boards so it is generally fairly easy to get an update regardless of your location or carrier.  However, the lack of an over-the-air facility and the massive downloads are very tedious.</p>

<h3>Update Statistics</h3>

<p>When you look at the two download mechanisms, one would expect that Android users would update their phones more frequently than iOS users, particularly as the update is delivered directly to the device.  However, the lack of support for devices and the requirement for carriers to approve updates means that only 0.8% of all Android users are currently running OS 2.3, with 57.6% on 2.2, 31.4% on 2.1, and the rest on pre 2.* software.  It is difficult to contrast fairly with iOS as Apple don't release breakdown usage stats, but by looking at the usage figures the major apps are publishing you can get an idea.  The number of users running iOS 4.* is around 90% with over 50% on the latest build of iOS 4.2 - there are only 10% running the previous generation family of 3.x and these are most likely users on the original iPhone and iPod Touches that aren't able to upgrade to iOS 4.0</p>

<p><strong>Android Figures accurate as of Feb 2nd, 2011 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Usage_share">from Wikipedia</a>)</strong><br>
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread): 0.8%<br>

Android 2.0/2.1 (Eclair): 31.4%<br>

Android 1.5 (Cupcake): 3.9%<br></p>

<p><strong>iOS Figures based on "Bump" application as of Jan 14th, 2011 (<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-proportion-of-all-iPhone-owners-use-iOS4-*-today">from Quora</a>)</strong><br>

<br>

iOS 3.2: 0.10 %<br>
<br>
iOS 3.1.3: 6.43 %<br>
iOS 3.1.2: 2.52 %<br>
iOS 3.1.1: 0.10 %<br>
iOS 3.1: 0.21 %<br>
<br>

iOS 3.0: 0.22 %<br>
<br>
iOS 2.2.1: 0.02 %<br>
iOS 2.2: 0.00 %
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>I'm still keenly waiting for my update to Android 2.2.3 as it adds, amongst other things, a new feature which enables the NFC chip in the Nexus S to write to tags as well as read from them (something that should have been there from the start in my opinion).  However, until my carrier pushes it out, I have to wait whilst other developers on US carriers get a head start.  This would be fine for the average user normally, but I fail to understand why Google aren't hosting a manual update?  An over-the-air update is convenient, but if there is a major bug fix then you should be able to download the update manually and do a tethered sync at the same time that Google pushes the update live.</p>

<p>The iOS system seems more archaic in that the updates are massive and you need to manually update, but the way in which Apple publicise the updates seems to ensure that users are updating.  Whilst the statistics above aren't wholly reliable, it shows a trend that users are aware of iOS updates and willing to plug in and upgrade. From my own anecdotal evidence, I've seen similar high numbers of upgrade take-up with many non-technical people in my family running the latest version of iOS without any help to do it.</p>

<p>The way that Apple has done this better is that they a) publicise a new release (going to <a href="http://android.com/">android.com</a> shows nothing about 2.3.3 aside from a blog post on the developer board directing you to download the SDK) and b) have a "check for updates" button that you can click when you hear that an update is available.  The Nexus S has a "System Updates" section within "Settings" but this only shows updates you've already been told about rather than forcing an update check.  From searching around the internet this afternoon looking for the update, I found a number of posts extolling the virtues of dialling <strong>*#*#2432546#*#*</strong> (which is *#*#checkin#*#*) which forces the device to do a checkin with your carrier and should push any updates that are waiting to you.  This is not an update system for the casual user!</p>

<p>Furthermore, Apple have unified their product line so that a new iOS update is immediately able to run on the iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone, and now the Apple TV.  There are certain devices which are excluded (e.g. the original iPhone and original iPod Touch) but these are well highlighted.  With Android, I have no idea which phones can or can't update and if there are technical limitations for this (as with the iOS updates) or simply the carriers not being bothered.  From <a href="http://androidspin.com/2011/01/12/breaking-t-mobile-internals-confirm-samsung-is-holding-the-android-world-hostage/">some reports</a>, it seems that the carriers are loathe to push out functional updates as they detract away from new products they are selling...</p>

<p>Overall, I think Apple needs to take some of the improvements in updating that Android has made such as pushing out incremental updates rather than forcing you to redownload the OS, and allowing you to update the OS without connecting to iTunes (even if this is only over Wi-Fi).  However, the major problem with Android is that it is stitched up with mobile carriers, something the iPhone broke away from.  When this extends to critical bug fixes, then it is the end user that suffers.  Apple needs to take some cues from Android in terms of implementation, but Google needs to take back more "openness" from the carriers if they are to provide a sufficient update system.</p>

			<a href="http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/product.asp?sn=242">WorldCard Mobile</a> is one of many applications that allows you to scan in a business card and have the details automatically loaded into your contacts.  I haven't used one of these kinds of applications in a long time and so I jumped at the chance to test one when a review copy was sent to me.   
<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/menu-300x500.png" alt="" title="WorldCard Mobile Menu Screen" width="300" height="500" class="size-medium wp-image-485" />

The opening screen is fairly straightforward with the option to start scanning either by taking a picture with the camera or using a photo from your library.  There is also an "Exit" button which I disagree with from a UI point of view as that is the point of the physical home button surely?  I'm probably being overly harsh as that kind of thing is prohibited by Apple and so I don't come across it much when looking at iOS apps, but I generally frown upon any duplication of standard controls with your own versions (for example, websites that have "back" buttons - that's what the standard browser "back" button is for!)

Anyway, I had a business card for one of my friends who works in Australia so I decided to give that a try by using the Camera feature.  This loads up a standard camera control and allows you to take your photo.

Once captured, you can zoom into the image, rotate it, and choose the correct language from a choice of seven; English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch.  Pressing the "Recognize" button will then fire up the OCR system that ran in under 1 second on my Nexus S.

As you can see, the captured data is incredibly accurate.  The only problem was with the word "Lisa" which came out as "Usa" but that is partially due to the closeness of the letters on the business card and me not taking a picture close enough.  I was particularly impressed with the intelligent way in which it parsed the data enabling it to set the fax numbers correctly as well as building the company name from the logo and footer and correctly picking out the job title.

Editing any information that wasn't correct is very easy with a standard editing dialogue.  I quickly fixed the name and saved before then pressing the export button.  This sends the contact information into your devices address book.  As I already had contact information for this person (pulled in automatically from FaceBook), it simply updated the existing record with the new work related information without any prompting.

Overall, I'm incredibly impressed with this app and the very fast and accurate OCR software built into it.  If you are frequently given business cards, I would highly recommend it as a quick and efficient way of storing them.

WorldCard Mobile costs $5.99 and is available on the Android MarketPlace.  There are other versions available at a higher price for recognising Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text.  You can find more details at <a href="http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/">http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/</a>

<strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on a Nexus S running Android 2.3.  If you have an app for iOS or Android that you would like me to review, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">contact me</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> WorldCard were kind enough to give me a review copy of their app for iPhone as well.  The interface is pretty much the same with very similar functionality although I did notice that the iPhone version allowed you to review your imported cards within the app (rather than just exporting them to the address book as on Android).  However, the recognition quality didn't seem to be as impressive as the Android version with several errors being made compared to the one basic error on the Android app.  I'm not sure if this is something to do with the code or with the iPhone hardware (although the tap to focus made me think the iPhone would function better) but for now I'll be using my Nexus S to do any business card recognition.

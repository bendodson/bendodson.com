			<p>Ever since <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/">I sold WallaBee</a>, I’ve been splitting my time between client work<sup id="fnref:clients"><a href="#fn:clients" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, my Xbox One, and doing small apps that help improve my life in little ways. Today, Apple finally approved<sup id="fnref:appstore"><a href="#fn:appstore" class="footnote">2</a></sup> my first self-published app in a long time, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Pocket Rocket</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/pocket-rocket.jpg" width="800" height="500" /></p>

<p>I save most articles that I want to read at a later date with <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> but I hate their mobile apps. Tapping an article will load their own reader view<sup id="fnref:broken"><a href="#fn:broken" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and it’s an extra step to jump to Safari. In addition, their apps aren’t updated for split screen support or new device sizes and so the experience is pretty poor. With Pocket Rocket, I wanted to do one thing; have my Pocket queue load up and then when you tap on an article it should load in Safari. I prefer using Safari as then you get to see the article as intended and with content blockers most pages load quickly. I got the basic version working within in an hour and it worked well enough for my needs; then, when I got the iPad Pro, I realised this could be a useful app for other people as it dramatically improves the reading experience especially when used in split screen mode.</p>

<p>Pocket Rocket is completely free with no ads or tracking<sup id="fnref:noads"><a href="#fn:noads" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. It runs on any device capable of running iOS 9 and is a fully adaptive so it looks great no matter what screen-size you have. Due to this adaptability, it works in all split-screen modes on applicable iPads and that is the way I tend to use it. You can swipe on an article to archive or delete it upon reading. There is also a settings panel so you can choose whether links open in Safari or via an in-app browser (with the option to enable a reader view<sup id="fnref:reader"><a href="#fn:reader" class="footnote">5</a></sup> on launch if you want).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;mt=8">get Pocket Rocket for free on the App Store</a>.</p>

      <p>I won’t go into details as Apple specifically request people don’t, but it has been one of the longest and most painful App Store review processes to date.

      <p>Literally nothing leaves your device apart from when you log in with Pocket (and that is a secure connection with Pocket’s servers via OAuth so I see nothing); I don’t want to know anything about you and respect your privacy.

			<time datetime="2015-12-17" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2015/12/17/natural-cycles-apple-watch-app/">December 17, 2015</a></time>

			<p>I’m very proud to announce that my first Apple Watch app for a client has gone live in the App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturalcycles/id765535549?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Natural Cycles</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-app.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/">Natural Cycles</a> is a popular iPhone and Android app that allows you to track your fertility or plan a pregnancy. It can tell you when you are fertile, when you are ovulating, when your next period is due, when you are pregnant, and the progress of your pregnancy. I was hired as a freelance Swift developer to build an Apple Watch app that would be bundled in with their big v2.0 update and would allow viewing and logging of this critical information. The app allows you to see your current fertility level, body temperature, and progress of your period as well as viewing messages from Natural Cycles. In addition, you can quickly update your current body temperature and menstrual flow within the app:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-log.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>As well as the core Apple Watch app, I also added support for Notifications and Glances making for an even quicker way to view your information:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-glance.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>My favourite feature, however, is the addition of full text Complications so you can see your current body temperature and fertility status on your watch face:<sup id="fnref:fertility"><a href="#fn:fertility" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-complication.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>The project was quite difficult (but rewarding!) for a few reasons. Firstly, the design was very ambitious when watchOS severely limits the amount of customisation that can be performed. Secondly, the iOS app was a Cordova app<sup id="fnref:cordova"><a href="#fn:cordova" class="footnote">2</a></sup> rather than a native app which meant I had to write a JavaScript plugin and set up some build scripts in order for the native Swift watchOS code to be able to speak with the iPhone. There was also a requirement to make the app as easy as possible to update (i.e. updating the iOS app shouldn’t break the watchOS app) and so I built everything such that the phone takes care of all logic and a lot of the UI so the watch app can be altered without going through the App Store review process.</p>

<p>This was a really exciting project to work on and I’m very happy with the end results. You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturalcycles/id765535549?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Natural Cycles from the App Store</a> or <a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/">learn more on their website</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:fertility">
      <p>This did lead to an awkward situation when I’d left the complication enabled on my Mickey Mouse face that I use at weekends; the weekend after testing was complete, I switched to my Mickey Mouse face to be greeted with the words “Not Fertile” underneath his tapping foot! <a href="#fnref:fertility" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:cordova">
      <p>I don’t usually work on non-native apps but I was willing to make an exception as the bulk of code I’d write would be fully native (as there is no way to write non-native apps on the Apple Watch due to the lack of a UIWebView) <a href="#fnref:cordova" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<p>I’ve been re-watching Star Wars<sup id="fnref:machete"><a href="#fn:machete" class="footnote">1</a></sup> this weekend in preparation for <em>The Force Awakens</em> and a special episode of <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/02/introducing-the-divide/">The Divide</a> we are recording after Christmas. When it got to the Death Star briefing sequence towards the end of <em>A New Hope</em>, I was reminded of an excellent video that came out after the original iPad announcement with a mashup of that sequence and Steve Jobs voiceover. I had a quick look for it and couldn’t find it as for some reason it had been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbHF63b7g50">removed from YouTube</a><sup id="fnref:legal"><a href="#fn:legal" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. After much searching, I eventually found a copy online but I’ve extracted it and saved it here to avoid it disappearing again in the future:</p>

			<time datetime="2015-12-09" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2015/12/09/using-the-siri-remote-with-the-apple-tv-simulator/">December 09, 2015</a></time>

			<p>I’ve been working on a tvOS app for a client recently which has led to a lot of time spent building to both the Apple TV hardware and simulator. Whilst the simulator is very good for basic testing, the simulated remote can be a bit tricky to use and so I was very pleased to discover today that the physical Siri Remote can be used with the Apple TV Simulator on El Capitan. All you have to do is pair your Siri Remote to your Mac and it’ll work in the simulator just like it does with the real thing.</p>

<p>The full set of steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Unpair your remote from your existing Apple TV (if applicable) by holding down the menu button and volume up button for around 5-10 seconds whilst the Apple TV is unplugged or otherwise out of Bluetooth range<sup id="fnref:pairing"><a href="#fn:pairing" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open up the Bluetooth settings panel in OS X; you should see a device with no details other than a mac address. Pair it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profit! Your Siri Remote is now paired and can be used in the simulator.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I have a 1080p external monitor plugged into my iMac 5k and so if I run the Apple TV simulator on that in fullscreen mode it feels almost exactly like using the real hardware. This could be a good stop gap for those on a budget as you could just <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLLC2ZM/A/siri-remote">buy a Siri Remote</a> for testing rather than the whole Apple TV<sup id="fnref:budget"><a href="#fn:budget" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. You should always test your apps on real hardware of course but this is a useful trick nonetheless.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:pairing">
      <p>Otherwise it’ll just unpair and repair very quickly - a frustrating way to spend 15 minutes on a Wednesday morning! <a href="#fnref:pairing" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:budget">
      <p>Or for developers who simply don’t want a second Apple TV. I’ve been moving mine between my office and living room for the past week and considered getting a second “development only” Apple TV to avoid this minor irritation; buying just a second remote seems a wiser investment. <a href="#fnref:budget" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

    	<div>
			<p>Every year we seem to buy a bigger Christmas tree. This year is no exception and it is now proving difficult to maneuver around it to turn the lights on and off. To fix this, I’ve connected my lights up to a <a href="http://www.belkin.com/uk/F7C027/p/P-F7C027/">Belkin WeMo</a> and I’m running the excellent <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">Homebridge</a><sup id="fnref:luke"><a href="#fn:luke" class="footnote">1</a></sup> server so that I can control it all via Siri:</p>

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBuMQ-PMyeY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>To get this up and running on your own machine, you’ll need to do the following in the Mac Terminal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ruby -e <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</span>
brew install node
sudo npm install -g homebridge
sudo npm install -g homebridge-wemo
homebridge</code></pre></div>

<p>This will install brew, install node, install Homebridge, install the WeMo plugin for Homebridge, and then attempt to run Homebridge (which will fail as you have no config file). Next, you’ll want to go to <code>~/.homebridge</code> and create a config.json file that looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;bridge&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

This name will be used by Siri. Make sure to update the &#39;wemo_name&#39; attribute with the EXACT name of the device in the WeMo app itself. This can be the same value as &#39;name&#39; but it doesn&#39;t have to be.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;wemo_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Christmas Tree&quot;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The important part is to make sure that the <code>wemo_name</code> matches the name of your device within the WeMo app; the <code>name</code> attribute is what you want your device to be called on HomeKit. Run the <code>homebridge</code> command again and you should see that your device is found and Homebridge is running.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need to get a HomeKit enabled app to run all of this. My recommendation is to use the one that Apple provides to developers, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/HomeKitCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html">HomeKit Catalog</a>, although that will require you to know how to sideload apps from Xcode. Alternatively you can download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/elgato-eve/id917695792">Elgato Eve app</a>. Once you have an app, you’ll need to add the Homebridge using the pin that is in your config file. You can play around with the app and create rooms, scenes, zones, etc, but for now the basic commands should work. If you can turn your device on and off via the HomeKit enabled app, you will be able to activate Siri and say “<em>turn on the Christmas tree</em>”, “<em>turn off the Christmas tree</em>”, and “<em>is the Christmas tree on?</em>”.</p>

<p>Added bonus: if you have an Apple TV, you are signed into iCloud, and you use iCloud keychain, then you’ll be able to use all of these voice commands when you’re outside of your house! It’s a pretty useful way to activate these devices and I have several of them dotted around my home<sup id="fnref:straighteners"><a href="#fn:straighteners" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Homebridge also supports many other services such as Philips Hue (without the need for their HomeKit bridge) and you can write your own plugins very easily<sup id="fnref:prismatik"><a href="#fn:prismatik" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My next task is to dig out some code I wrote last year to turn the tree lights on and off automatically depending on if I’m in the house using an iBeacon…</p>

			<p>A big update I worked on for <a href="https://www.brapp.tv">Brapp</a> went live today on the App Store. It’s the first major update for the app and adds the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You can now adjust audio levels of yourself and the beat after recording. Sweet.</li>
    <li>You can now rotate videos after recording so you’re not sideways when you don’t want to be.</li>
    <li>We’ve added 5 new video filters! Ice, Whitewash, Planet Rock, Purple Haze and Blackout.</li>
    <li>We’ve added controls for brightness and video filter intensity so there are infinite variations.</li>
    <li>The new video player is faster, smoother, lighter to control and does not overlay on top of videos.</li>
    <li>Producer’s names now show on videos made on their beats.</li>
    <li>The new beat player shows real waveforms because real waveforms rule.</li>
    <li>You can now loop beats by pressing the ∞ button.</li>
    <li>Spins now show on beats! Spins are all the plays of a beat INCLUDING plays of videos made on them.</li>
    <li>You can now filter your Saved Beats by title, producer name, #hashtag and bpm.</li>
    <li>You can now edit info on your beats &amp; videos. Phew.</li>
    <li>When you make a video you can see it’s progress as it uploads, you no longer have to wait hopingly!</li>
    <li>When you tap the beat icon on any video it shows you the beat, now it also shows you all the other - videos made on that beat on the same page.</li>
    <li>When commenting on a beat/video it won’t stop playing what you are listening to.</li>
    <li>You can tap profile pictures to make them big.</li>
    <li>It is now easier to find your Facebook and Twitter friends, and connect with popular users on Brapp.</li>
    <li>And there’s a heap of other handsome UI, UX and stability updates. P.s. We’re just getting started!</li>
  </ul>

			<p>I’m happy to announce that an iPhone app I’ve been working on since September this year has gone live in the App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chippd/id570739404?mt=8">Chipp’d v2.0</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-app.jpg" width="800" /></p>

<p>Chipp’d is an app that works with real world products (available at <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d">John Lewis</a>) to let you share secrets or private messages with your friends. You simply scan the QR code on the sticker, create your secret (with video, audio, photos, and text), and send the sticker or card; your friend will then be able to see that secret when they scan it with the app or any other QR scanner.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-code.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>It is also possible to share secrets for free using the app via auto-generated URLs that can be sent via email or SMS.</p>

<p>I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the CTO of Chipp’d to integrate their existing API into the product on an incredibly agressive timescale<sup id="fnref:timescale"><a href="#fn:timescale" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Everything was written in Swift 2.0 and used AutoLayout for flexible layouts on all iPhone screen sizes. I’m particularly proud of the QR scanner which I custom built when it transpired that the products that had been printed and shipped to distributors were too light for a conventional QR scanner to detect; I used GPUImage to manipulate the live video feed with multiple filters per second in order to quickly scan at different brightnesses and solve the issue before it caused major problems.</p>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chippd/id570739404?mt=8">Chipp’d on the App Store</a> (it’s free) and you can purchase the stickers and cards to use with it at <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d">John Lewis</a>.</p>

			<p>iOS provides a number of useful modal views within it’s system frameworks with everything from sending email to taking photos or video. However, there is still not a standard way to perform what is a fairly basic task; recording a voice memo.</p>

<p>I had a need for such a feature on a project recently and so I put together <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/AudioRecorderViewController-Swift">AudioRecorderViewController</a>. It’s a basic modal view controller that allows you to record, playback, re-record, and save audio locally in mp4 format.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/audiorecorderviewcontroller.jpg" width="800" /></p>

<p>Usage is insanely simple and modelled on such classes as <code>UIImagePickerController</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="p">@</span><span class="kt">IBAction</span> <span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">presentAudioRecorder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">sender</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">AnyObject</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

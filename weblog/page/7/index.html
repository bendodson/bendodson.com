    	<div>
			<p>I’m very happy to announce that my latest self-published app, <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/">Music Tracker</a>, is now <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">available on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-hero.jpg" width="800" height="542" /></p>

<p>Music Tracker is an iPhone app that keeps an eye on your music library and monitors additions, deletions, and any changes to your songs. With streaming becoming more popular, it is very easy for song metadata to change or for songs to disappear as licensing deals expire; with Music Tracker, you will always know when something in your library changes whether it was by you, a family member, or your streaming service.</p>

<p>I came up with the idea for Music Tracker after noticing that the amount of songs returned by iTunes was different to that in my Music app on my iPhone. This was due to a song I had in Apple Music that was no longer available in the UK and so had been automatically deleted from my iPhone and greyed out in my iTunes library on my mac. After a quick prototype, I had an app that would run on my phone and keep track of any deletions and additions so I’d be alerted if Apple altered my music. After a few weeks, there were several changes picked up by my app including a few songs that were just plain deleted and some that were completely altered (i.e. I had a studio recording of <em>Uptown Girl</em> by Billy Joel that was switched for a live recording - with Music Tracker, I could see this change and switch it out for a studio recording from a different album).</p>

<p>In my original prototype version, I actually exported the entire music library as a JSON file and uploaded it to GitHub<sup id="fnref:github"><a href="#fn:github" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, to make it work natively on the device without an internet connection I made use of the <a href="http://realm.io">Realm</a> mobile database which is fantastic and insanely fast. The entire process of extracting the metadata from your library, comparing it against the existing dataset saved in Realm, and then creating a log of changes, additions, and deletions takes around 2.2 seconds on a library of 10000 songs<sup id="fnref:mileage"><a href="#fn:mileage" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and allows a full activity feed showing changes on a granular level:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-flow.jpg" width="800" height="417" /></p>

<p>From a technical point of view, there are 3 different ways in which Music Tracker can update depending on the options you choose during setup:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you enable push notifications, then a silent push notification<sup id="fnref:silent"><a href="#fn:silent" class="footnote">3</a></sup> will be sent to your device once an hour that wakes up the app in the background and checks for any changes. This typically lasts around 2 seconds on a standard library of 10000 songs and in my opinion is a pretty clever way of getting around the fact that you can’t schedule background tasks on iOS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t enable push notifications, the app will make use of Background App Refresh (limited to once per hour) to do an update in the background in a similar way to the silent push notifications. These typically fire when the phone is connected to WiFi and a power source but mileage will vary depending on what apps you have installed (and for that reason I recommend the silent push option).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you go into iPhone settings and disable Background App Refresh, then the only way to update the library is to open the app and pull to refresh (or use the 3D Touch Quick Action if you have an iPhone 6s / 6s Plus).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Before finishing the app, I added full 3D touch support (both quick actions and “Peek and Pop”) and a basic Apple Watch app that allows you to see how many songs are in your library, and how many songs have been added, changed, or deleted today (along with name and artist of those tracks). In addition, there is a glance providing this information in a single screen and text-based complications for the Utility, Modular, and Mickey Mouse faces with a quick summary of your library today.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-watch.jpg" width="800" height="417" /></p>

<p>This was the first project in which I used <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> for the provisioning profile, certificate generation, push notification setup, TestFlight, and iTunes Connect submission and I’d highly recommend it; so much simpler than doing those things manually! The TestFlight beta test was also well worth doing as with something like this I could only really test on a handful of devices but I needed to see load times on other devices and larger libraries - a big thank you to all of my beta testers. Once the app was submitted, I was honestly expecting the app to be rejected but it went straight through review without a problem<sup id="fnref:update"><a href="#fn:update" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The final thing to mention is an issue of privacy. I’m very proud of the fact that no data leaves your device from this app<sup id="fnref:analytics"><a href="#fn:analytics" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and I have a simple and transparent <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><sup id="fnref:summary"><a href="#fn:summary" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. However, I do think it is bizarre that iOS does not require any permissions dialogue when accessing the music library. I <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/">wrote a post about this last week</a> detailing this big privacy flaw and I’ve submitted a bug report to Apple (<a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192">rdar://24168798</a>) in the hope that a standard privacy alert will be added in iOS 10.</p>

<p>You can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Music Tracker on the App Store</a> (priced at $0.99 / £0.79) and learn more about it on my <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/">Dodo Apps website</a>. If you are interested in reviewing Music Tracker or writing an article surrounding the privacy issue, you may can <a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-media-kit.zip">download the media kit</a> which contains more information along with screenshots, mockups, and app icons.</p>

    <li id="fn:github">
      <p>You can see how this looked by seeing the commit log at <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/music-library">https://github.com/bendodson/music-library</a> <a href="#fnref:github" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:mileage">
      <p>Your mileage may vary depending on how many songs you have in your library and what device you are using; it’s obviously faster on an iPhone 6s than a 5s. The app requires a 64-bit processor due to this and so will not run on the iPhone 4s, 5, or 5c. <a href="#fnref:mileage" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:silent">
      <p>The key part here is “silent”. These notifications wake up your phone and do some processing but you don’t receive any alerts, sounds, or badge icon updates unless you specifically opt-in to the “Summary Notification” within the settings panel (and that sends a simple text alert once per day if your library changed on the previous day). <a href="#fnref:silent" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>There are no analytics or tracking of any kind.

			<time datetime="2016-01-13" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/">January 13, 2016</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p><strong>UPDATE: Thanks to my raising this privacy concern, <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/08/02/media-library-privacy-flaw-fixed-in-ios-10/">Apple have resolved this issue as of iOS 10</a>. I’ve left the old post below for posterity.</strong></p>

<p>Over the years Apple has put a lot of effort into making iOS secure and privacy focussed. You are prompted with dialogue boxes whenever an app tries to access your contacts, calendars, photos, or location and you need to confirm that you want to receive notifications. However, whilst developing <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/">Music Tracker</a><sup id="fnref:musictracker"><a href="#fn:musictracker" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I discovered that there is no privacy prompt when a developer tries to access your library. In fact, they can access all of your music data as simply as this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span></span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">query</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="bp">MPMediaQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">songsQuery</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">items</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">query</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">items</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    	<span class="n">NSLog</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Title: </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s just a basic example that’ll output the title of every song in your library but there is a lot of danger in that. This process happens completely silently and in my tests I was able to loop through a library of 10000 songs, put all the metadata in a JSON file<sup id="fnref:json"><a href="#fn:json" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, and upload it to a server in under 2 seconds!</p>

<p>But why is this a security or privacy risk? Off the top of my head, I can think of two massive risks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your library says a lot about you<sup id="fnref:bwitched"><a href="#fn:bwitched" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. If an advertising company was able to get a complete list of your music library (along with changes to it over time) then they could very easily target you with specific ads. Added a lot of Taylor Swift recently? Here are some ads relevant to that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When iOS first came out there was something called a UDID which basically identified your device uniquely. This was used by marketers to track you across multiple apps and build up a profile. This was stopped by Apple a few years back and replaced with an advertising identifier which you can turn off and which can only be used between apps from the same company (where they are probably already tracking you). However, with a full music library, it would be fairly easy to track someone across multiple apps as periodic snapshots could be compared on a server.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve no idea if apps are already doing this in the background silently but it is something that shouldn’t be able to happen. To that end, I’ve filed a bug report with Apple (<a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192">rdar://24168798</a>) to ask that they implement the same privacy controls that they do for contacts, calendars, photos, and location; a prompt when an app tries to access this data and the ability to grant or reject that permission through the system wide settings. Hopefully this is something Apple will implement in iOS 10 – if you’d like to see this happen, please duplicate bug 24168798 in the <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com">Apple Bug Reporter</a> as that is the best way to bring it to their attention.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 20th Jan 2016:</strong> A few people have pointed out that the first beta of iOS 9.3 does have a new privacy setting for “Media Library”. However, this does not stop the above line of code and read-only access to your library; instead, it is part of a new feature that allows for apps to add songs to your iCloud Music Library but requires your permission to do so. Apps that use the MPMediaQuery above won’t even appear in the Media Library permissions page to disable so this is not the solution some think it is.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 23rd Feb 2016:</strong> Several articles are now linking to this and picking up on my comments about iOS 9.3 above and horribly misunderstanding what those new APIs do. I’ve published a <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/">new article detailing exactly what the new APIs in iOS 9.3 add to the music library</a> (and what they don’t add). As of iOS 9.3 beta 4, there are no privacy controls on scanning your music library and it still works exactly as I’ve described above.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 25th March 2016:</strong> With the public release of iOS 9.3, this issue is not resolved <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/">as per my post last month</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 13th June 2016:</strong> Thanks to my raising awareness of this issue, iOS 10 (released in beta for developers today) has added full privacy controls for read access to the local media library. I’ll write up a post in the future about how the new APIs work (<a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/08/02/media-library-privacy-flaw-fixed-in-ios-10/">done</a>).</p>

			<p>I’m very pleased to announce that another client app I developed recently has gone live in the App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Munchkin Report for iPhone</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-hero.jpg" width="800" height="532" /></p>

<p><a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">Munchkin Report</a> is an online service that helps you track your child’s moments, big and small. From her first steps to yesterday’s nap schedule, Munchkin Report captures memories, keeps parents and caregivers in-sync, and helps you make informed decisions.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure to work on this app as I was able to work in an incredibly efficient way. The client provided me with a complete API (including full documentation<sup id="fnref:apidocumentation"><a href="#fn:apidocumentation" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) and some static wireframes; I was then left to my own devices for a couple of weeks and given creative freedom to build my own design and tweak the UX as I saw fit. In the end I settled on an iOS 7 style minimal design which puts the important information up front and uses bold colours for UI controls.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-flow.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>The design is optimised for all four sizes of iPhone from the tiny iPhone 4s to the massive iPhone 6s Plus. It was written in Swift 2.1 and runs on iOS 9.0 and greater.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-3d-touch.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>I had just received my iPhone 6s when I started the project so as a little extra<sup id="fnref:extratouch"><a href="#fn:extratouch" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I added 3D touch quick actions so you can quickly get to the log actions from the home screen. There is also “Peek and Pop” integration throughout.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased with the way this app turned out and I think it’ll be a great resource for childcarers and parents. Munchkin Report is free but does require an account from <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">munchkinreport.com</a> (free trials are available). You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Munchkin Report from the App Store</a> or <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">learn more on their website</a>.</p>

      <p>You’d be surprised how rare that is! <a href="#fnref:apidocumentation" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:extratouch">
      <p>One of the main reasons I do client work is so I can experiment with new APIs I wouldn’t necessarily use if I was just doing my own apps. I often add features for free to client apps to give me a bit more experience using a certain framework. <a href="#fnref:extratouch" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<time datetime="2016-01-13" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/13/calm-radio-for-apple-tv/">January 13, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>I’m very pleased to announce that my first tvOS app for a client has gone live in the Apple TV App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Calm Radio</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio.jpg" width="800" height="574" /></p>

<p><a href="https://calmradio.com/">Calm Radio</a> is an ubiquitous online radio service with over 150 channels dedicated to specific genres of music and relaxation such as meditation, piano, jazz, latin, and so on. It is free to listen to (with no account) but you can remove ads from the stream and get access to special features with a paid account.</p>

<p>With the Apple TV, I wanted to make the app fit in like a first class citizen of the platform and so I did all of the design and UX work myself with a focus on real time blurs and gradients. As you navigate around the huge array of channels, the background will subtley shift to softer versions of the key colours used in the artwork.</p>

<p>When you select a channel, you are shown a now playing page that has the title, artist, album, and artwork of the currently playing music. The background is a soft version of the channel artwork but you can choose one of 12 high definition videos to play in the background instead. These videos are looped and blended with the background gradient in order to keep the experience consistent and relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-atmospheres.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>You can choose up to 3 atmospheres (such as wind, rain, waterfalls, crickets, etc) to mix with the currently playing channel and they appear underneath the artwork of the currently playing track. I designed an intuitive and simple UI for this so that listeners could change the volume of each individual atmosphere relative to the channel without using sliders<sup id="fnref:sliders"><a href="#fn:sliders" class="footnote">1</a></sup> or cluttering the interface.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to use as many tvOS features as possible and so I built in support for the “Top Shelf” allowing you to see and play various channels direct from the TV home screen.</p>

<p>This has been a great project to work on and I’ve learned a huge amount about the Apple TV and the ‘Focus Engine’ that powers it<sup id="fnref:simulator"><a href="#fn:simulator" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. It’s been a lot of fun to do my own UX and design work and I think it’s turned out really well; the client was so pleased with it that I’ve been hired to rebuild their existing universal iPhone and iPad app to make it match this design!</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Calm Radio from the Apple TV App Store</a><sup id="fnref:calmradioapp"><a href="#fn:calmradioapp" class="footnote">3</a></sup> or <a href="https://calmradio.com/">learn more on their website</a>.</p>

Chris, John, and myself discuss over 40 games that are being released this year and pick out a few of our favourites including Crackdown 3, Final Fantasy XV, Zelda, Mass Effect, Street Fighter V, and Yooka-Laylee. We also spend some time discussing the Oculus Rift pre-order and I have a bit of a rant about the rumoured removal of the audio headphone jack from the next iPhone<sup id="fnref:headphone"><a href="#fn:headphone" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Finally, Chris is still upset with JJ Abrams…</p>

			<time datetime="2016-01-11" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/11/fixing-emoji-footnote-arrow-in-jekyll/">January 11, 2016</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my static blog generator for a few years now but noticed a minor annoyance a few days ago; whenever I use footnotes<sup id="fnref:footnotes"><a href="#fn:footnotes" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the return arrow (↩︎) is converted into an emoji (<a href="http://emojipedia.org/leftwards-arrow-with-hook/️">↩️</a>) on iOS and in some RSS readers. Obviously this isn’t desirable and so after a bit of digging I was able to find a fix.</p>

<p>Firstly, this isn’t an issue with Jekyll but with <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org">kramdown</a> which does the Markdown conversion. Thankfully, there is a config option in kramdown 1.8.0 and above<sup id="fnref:kramdown"><a href="#fn:kramdown" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that lets you specify the text you want to use for the footnote return link and you can set it as unicode to stop it being converted to emoji. Just add the following to your <code>_config.yml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>kramdown:
  	  footnote_backlink: "&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;"
</code></pre>

<p>Regenerate your site and you should find that the emoji arrow is now back to a ↩︎.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/">selling WallaBee last year</a>, I changed my company name to <strong>Dodo Apps Ltd</strong>. Now that I’m publishing my own apps again (in addition to my freelance work), it seemed time for me to make a few changes to my website.</p>

<p>Today I’ve updated bendodson.com so that my <a href="https://bendodson.com/clients/">client work</a> and my <a href="https://bendodson.com/apps/">self-published apps</a> are now in separate sections<sup id="fnref:photos"><a href="#fn:photos" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I have also created a new site at <a href="https://dodoapps.io">dodoapps.io</a> to advertise my own apps that are currently available in the App Store<sup id="fnref:musictracker"><a href="#fn:musictracker" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I am currently available for freelance work from February 2016. For more details, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>

			<time datetime="2016-01-06" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/06/swift-extension-calayer-uicolor-interface-builder/">January 06, 2016</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p>I’ve been using Interface Builder in more projects over the past few months due to the benefits of AutoLayout. This has led to me shifting more standard UI code (i.e. colors, borders, shadows, etc) into Interface Builder via the User Defined Runtime Attributes<sup id="fnref:udra"><a href="#fn:udra" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, this doesn’t work for the CALayer properties <code>shadowColor</code> and <code>borderColor</code> as they expect a CGColor rather than a UIColor.</p>

<p>To fix this in a recent project, <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift">I created a very basic CALayer extension</a> (in Swift) that adds UIColor accessors so you can set them via the User Defined Runtime Attributes as so:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-example.png" width="600" height="140" /></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift">get the extension on GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:udra">
      <p>You basically just set <code>layer.cornerRadius</code> as the key path and use an NSNumber within the User Defined Runtime attributes and then Interface Builder will handle the rest - no more filling your code with <code>button.layer.cornerRadius = 8</code>, etc. <a href="#fnref:udra" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<p>After a slight delay in recording, Episode 5 of <a href="http://thedivide.co.uk/">The Divide</a> is now available. As a New Year treat, this show is a 2 hour special all about Star Wars. We discuss the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, some of our favourite Star Wars video games and comics, and then dive into Episode VII, ‘The Force Awakens’ (there are numerous spoilers but we confined them all to the last half hour or so and there is a big warning before we start). We also discuss one of my favourite oddities in the re-release versions, the addition of CGI rocks to Episode IV:</p>

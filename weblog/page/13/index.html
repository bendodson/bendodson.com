    	<div>
			<p>Over the last couple of months, I've been using two competing phones day-today; a Nexus S (Android) and an iPhone 4 (iOS).  Whilst there are many differences and similarities, one of the things I want to talk about today is the different ways in which they deal with updates to the core operating system.  System updates are a crucial part of the mobile experience - sometimes they offer major new features but they are usually minor updates to deal with bug fixes.  So how do Apple and Google deliver their system updates?</p>
<h3>Android</h3>

<p>The Android platform updates itself via an "over-the-air" system which appears to rely on individual carriers to push out system updates.  Due to the large number of different devices, certain updates will only appear for certain phones and this fragments further by region and carrier.  For example, Android 2.3.3 came out 2 days ago and only runs on the Nexus S at present - whilst a number of customers in the US have received the update, my Nexus S is still refusing to detect an update from 2.3.2 leaving me to conclude that it is waiting for my carrier to push it out.  However, when an update does appear, the process is very slick.  A notification appears to let you know you have an update including details of what this adds and the size (which for minor updates tends to be a couple of MB).  One tap starts the download process and, once complete, the phone reboots and you're up and running.  At no point do you need to plug into a computer or even connect to a wireless network. It's very impressive.  However, the lack of cohesive strategy on when updates will appear and on what devices they will work on causes the whole process to be a bit of a disappointment, especially when you're waiting on a major bug fix or new feature.</p>

<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>The iOS update system is very different.  Each update requires you to plug your iPhone into iTunes where an update will then download and sync to the phone.  Each update includes the entire OS, rather than an incremental update, so is typically around 450MB (depending on device).  This takes a long time to download but then takes about the same time again to install onto the device.  The advantage to this process is that if something goes wrong you can restore from a backup immediately (whereas on an Android phone in the wild you'd be stuck without a phone).  Also, when an update is available, it is generally available globally within 2 hours of release and there is a button you can press to check for updates manually.  Apple also post a direct download link on their support boards so it is generally fairly easy to get an update regardless of your location or carrier.  However, the lack of an over-the-air facility and the massive downloads are very tedious.</p>

<h3>Update Statistics</h3>

<p>When you look at the two download mechanisms, one would expect that Android users would update their phones more frequently than iOS users, particularly as the update is delivered directly to the device.  However, the lack of support for devices and the requirement for carriers to approve updates means that only 0.8% of all Android users are currently running OS 2.3, with 57.6% on 2.2, 31.4% on 2.1, and the rest on pre 2.* software.  It is difficult to contrast fairly with iOS as Apple don't release breakdown usage stats, but by looking at the usage figures the major apps are publishing you can get an idea.  The number of users running iOS 4.* is around 90% with over 50% on the latest build of iOS 4.2 - there are only 10% running the previous generation family of 3.x and these are most likely users on the original iPhone and iPod Touches that aren't able to upgrade to iOS 4.0</p>

<p><strong>Android Figures accurate as of Feb 2nd, 2011 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Usage_share">from Wikipedia</a>)</strong><br>
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread): 0.8%<br>
Android 2.2 (Froyo): 57.6%<br>
Android 2.0/2.1 (Eclair): 31.4%<br>
Android 1.6 (Donut): 6.3%<br>
Android 1.5 (Cupcake): 3.9%<br></p>

<p><strong>iOS Figures based on "Bump" application as of Jan 14th, 2011 (<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-proportion-of-all-iPhone-owners-use-iOS4-*-today">from Quora</a>)</strong><br>
iOS 4.2.1: 52.89 %<br>
iOS 4.2: 0.09 %<br>
<br>
iOS 4.1: 27.50 %<br>
<br>

<br>
iOS 3.2.2: 0.49 %<br>
iOS 3.2.1: 0.07 %<br>
iOS 3.2: 0.10 %<br>
<br>
iOS 3.1.3: 6.43 %<br>
iOS 3.1.2: 2.52 %<br>
iOS 3.1.1: 0.10 %<br>
iOS 3.1: 0.21 %<br>
<br>
iOS 3.0.1: 0.10 %<br>
iOS 3.0: 0.22 %<br>
<br>
iOS 2.2.1: 0.02 %<br>
iOS 2.2: 0.00 %
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>I'm still keenly waiting for my update to Android 2.2.3 as it adds, amongst other things, a new feature which enables the NFC chip in the Nexus S to write to tags as well as read from them (something that should have been there from the start in my opinion).  However, until my carrier pushes it out, I have to wait whilst other developers on US carriers get a head start.  This would be fine for the average user normally, but I fail to understand why Google aren't hosting a manual update?  An over-the-air update is convenient, but if there is a major bug fix then you should be able to download the update manually and do a tethered sync at the same time that Google pushes the update live.</p>

<p>The iOS system seems more archaic in that the updates are massive and you need to manually update, but the way in which Apple publicise the updates seems to ensure that users are updating.  Whilst the statistics above aren't wholly reliable, it shows a trend that users are aware of iOS updates and willing to plug in and upgrade. From my own anecdotal evidence, I've seen similar high numbers of upgrade take-up with many non-technical people in my family running the latest version of iOS without any help to do it.</p>

<p>The way that Apple has done this better is that they a) publicise a new release (going to <a href="http://android.com/">android.com</a> shows nothing about 2.3.3 aside from a blog post on the developer board directing you to download the SDK) and b) have a "check for updates" button that you can click when you hear that an update is available.  The Nexus S has a "System Updates" section within "Settings" but this only shows updates you've already been told about rather than forcing an update check.  From searching around the internet this afternoon looking for the update, I found a number of posts extolling the virtues of dialling <strong>*#*#2432546#*#*</strong> (which is *#*#checkin#*#*) which forces the device to do a checkin with your carrier and should push any updates that are waiting to you.  This is not an update system for the casual user!</p>

<p>Furthermore, Apple have unified their product line so that a new iOS update is immediately able to run on the iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone, and now the Apple TV.  There are certain devices which are excluded (e.g. the original iPhone and original iPod Touch) but these are well highlighted.  With Android, I have no idea which phones can or can't update and if there are technical limitations for this (as with the iOS updates) or simply the carriers not being bothered.  From <a href="http://androidspin.com/2011/01/12/breaking-t-mobile-internals-confirm-samsung-is-holding-the-android-world-hostage/">some reports</a>, it seems that the carriers are loathe to push out functional updates as they detract away from new products they are selling...</p>

<p>Overall, I think Apple needs to take some of the improvements in updating that Android has made such as pushing out incremental updates rather than forcing you to redownload the OS, and allowing you to update the OS without connecting to iTunes (even if this is only over Wi-Fi).  However, the major problem with Android is that it is stitched up with mobile carriers, something the iPhone broke away from.  When this extends to critical bug fixes, then it is the end user that suffers.  Apple needs to take some cues from Android in terms of implementation, but Google needs to take back more "openness" from the carriers if they are to provide a sufficient update system.</p>

			<time datetime="2011-01-23" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/01/23/review-worldcard-mobile-for-android/">January 23, 2011</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<a href="http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/product.asp?sn=242">WorldCard Mobile</a> is one of many applications that allows you to scan in a business card and have the details automatically loaded into your contacts.  I haven't used one of these kinds of applications in a long time and so I jumped at the chance to test one when a review copy was sent to me.   
<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/menu-300x500.png" alt="" title="WorldCard Mobile Menu Screen" width="300" height="500" class="size-medium wp-image-485" />

The opening screen is fairly straightforward with the option to start scanning either by taking a picture with the camera or using a photo from your library.  There is also an "Exit" button which I disagree with from a UI point of view as that is the point of the physical home button surely?  I'm probably being overly harsh as that kind of thing is prohibited by Apple and so I don't come across it much when looking at iOS apps, but I generally frown upon any duplication of standard controls with your own versions (for example, websites that have "back" buttons - that's what the standard browser "back" button is for!)

Anyway, I had a business card for one of my friends who works in Australia so I decided to give that a try by using the Camera feature.  This loads up a standard camera control and allows you to take your photo.

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/card-capture-300x500.png" alt="" title="WorldCard Mobile - Capture" width="300" height="500" class="size-medium wp-image-486" />

Once captured, you can zoom into the image, rotate it, and choose the correct language from a choice of seven; English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch.  Pressing the "Recognize" button will then fire up the OCR system that ran in under 1 second on my Nexus S.

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/capture-300x500.png" alt="" title="WorldCard Mobile - Captured Information" width="300" height="500" class="size-medium wp-image-487" />

As you can see, the captured data is incredibly accurate.  The only problem was with the word "Lisa" which came out as "Usa" but that is partially due to the closeness of the letters on the business card and me not taking a picture close enough.  I was particularly impressed with the intelligent way in which it parsed the data enabling it to set the fax numbers correctly as well as building the company name from the logo and footer and correctly picking out the job title.

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/edit-300x500.png" alt="" title="WorldCard Mobile - Edit Contact" width="300" height="500" class="size-medium wp-image-488" />

Editing any information that wasn't correct is very easy with a standard editing dialogue.  I quickly fixed the name and saved before then pressing the export button.  This sends the contact information into your devices address book.  As I already had contact information for this person (pulled in automatically from FaceBook), it simply updated the existing record with the new work related information without any prompting.

Overall, I'm incredibly impressed with this app and the very fast and accurate OCR software built into it.  If you are frequently given business cards, I would highly recommend it as a quick and efficient way of storing them.

WorldCard Mobile costs $5.99 and is available on the Android MarketPlace.  There are other versions available at a higher price for recognising Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text.  You can find more details at <a href="http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/">http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/</a>

<strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on a Nexus S running Android 2.3.  If you have an app for iOS or Android that you would like me to review, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">contact me</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> WorldCard were kind enough to give me a review copy of their app for iPhone as well.  The interface is pretty much the same with very similar functionality although I did notice that the iPhone version allowed you to review your imported cards within the app (rather than just exporting them to the address book as on Android).  However, the recognition quality didn't seem to be as impressive as the Android version with several errors being made compared to the one basic error on the Android app.  I'm not sure if this is something to do with the code or with the iPhone hardware (although the tap to focus made me think the iPhone would function better) but for now I'll be using my Nexus S to do any business card recognition.

			<time datetime="2011-01-13" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/01/13/enabling-any-html5-video-to-work-over-airplay-e-g-vimeo/">January 13, 2011</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>It's taken a little while longer than I expected to but I've managed to put together a script to make any HTML 5 video playable through Safari on the iPad.  With the advent of iOS 4.3, Apple are now allowing websites to add a special tag to their video markup in order to enable video streaming (as with the current 4.2 version you only get audio streaming).  However, with one simple JavaScript bookmarklet, you can now enable AirPlay video for any website.   
First of all, you'll need to save the following bookmark - the best way is to save the link below as a bookmark on your computer and then sync it to your iPad via iTunes or MobileMe: <strong><a href="javascript:d=document,e=d.createElement('script');e.src='https://bendodson.com/bookmarklets/ios-airplay.js?'+(new%20Date()*1);void(d.body.appendChild(e));">HTML5 AirPlay Bookmarklet</a></strong>.  Alternatively, bookmark this page on your iPad and then copy the text below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">javascript</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;script&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://bendodson.com/bookmarklets/ios-airplay.js?&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="nb">Date</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="k">void</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">));</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You now need to edit the bookmark you saved for this page and paste the code above into the URL (you'll probably want to rename it as well).</p>

<p>Once the bookmark is saved, you just need to go to any HTML 5 video (such as cnn.com or tvcatchup.com) online and start playing it.  You'll notice if you look at the AirPlay window that you can only stream audio.  If you now load the bookmark, the video should disappear, and then come back with AirPlay now enabled for video.  This short video below will demonstrate the process a little better:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/18730809?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>So how does it work?  To get AirPlay to send a video stream in Safari, you need to add the attribute <code>x-webkit-airplay="allow"</code> to the <code>video</code> tag.  I assumed that by adding this to an existing video via JavaScript then it would automatically work.  However, Apple have been slightly clever and ignore any parameters you add via JavaScript.  So, I instead use JavaScript to add the new attribute before cloning the video, removing it from the DOM, and then re-adding it.  This re-addition to the DOM seems to trigger something in Safari which causes it to re-read the AirPlay attribute and allow you to stream the video.  Please note that this will only work with iOS 4.3 on the iPad with iOS 4.3 on the Apple TV.  If you try and stream to an Apple TV running older software, Safari will crash.</p>

<p>This is currently in a very rough stage yet so far has been tested and works with vimeo.com as well as native HTML 5 video on websites such as apple.com - it doesn't work with any HTML 5 video wrapped in a custom skin (e.g. the BBC iPlayer) but who knows what will be possible in the future.  If you have any additions or improvements, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few people have contacted me about embedded videos such as the one on this page. Unfortunately, with Vimeo at least, these don't work as they are packaged up in an iFrame rather than being native <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> content.  JavaScript isn't able to access the contents of an iFrame from a different domain due to the cross-domain security policy.  If videos are embedded natively, then they'll play fine, but for iFrame content you'll need to go to the original website.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This workaround is still functioning in iOS 4.3 beta 2.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And it is still working in iOS 4.3 beta 3.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And finally, this works in the publicly available version of iOS 4.3 - enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've altered the article slightly as vimeo.com is now adding the AirPlay functionality automatically to their website (so I've changed the examples given). I've also added a copy-paste section of code as that may be easier for getting the bookmarklet onto your iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've taken a look at using this on iOS 5.0 beta 1 but so far the AirPlay functionality isn't working well. This is more likely an issue with the beta (which is fairly buggy).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> iOS 5 has changed the defaults for how AirPlay works. This means that all online video is now classed as AirPlay enabled (unless the content provider opts out) making this bookmark now redundant.</p>

			<p>As I <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/11/thoughts-on-the-verizon-iphone-4/">predicted yesterday</a>, iOS 4.3 has now become available for developers with the hotspot functionality demoed on the Verizion iPhone 4 now available to all.  It works by replacing the previous &quot;Internet Tethering&quot; functionality with everything being included under one banner.  This means you can now tether your iPhone via Bluetooth, USB, or WiFI (along with 5 other devices).  The carrier support is exactly the same as for internet tethering so if you are already paying for that (or get it for free), then you will be able to use the new hotspot functionality free of charge.</p>
<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/IMG_0161-333x500.png" alt="" title="iOS 4.3 Personal Hotspot" width="333" height="500" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-467" />
<p>Unfortunately, I can't demo the hotspot at the moment as I don't currently pay for tethering.  The reason for this is that my carrier (O2) charges an extra £7.50 per month for an extra 500MB to use for data tethering.  You can't use the data allowance you already have.  This is in stark contrast to Android in which you can use the device as a Wi-Fi hotspot with no charge at all - it just shares your existing connection.  I was rather hoping that Apple would move away from this money-grabbing opportunity for the carriers but it seems not. </p>
<p>In addition to this change, there is also an update for AirPlay relating specifically to the Apple TV.  As I tweeted previously, you could enable AirPlay video streaming in 3rd party apps due to a private method on the MPMoviePlayerController class.  However, Apple have now made this public with an update for the AppleTV as well.  This means that 3rd party apps can now stream video to the AppleTV which is great news for apps such as MLB (which mean I can stream video from my iPad to my AppleTV - no more baseball games on the iPhone for me!).  Other changes are mainly cosmetic with a slight rearrangement of the settings panel and some new multi-touch gestures for the iPad.  Interestingly, Apple have responded to the controversy around the reassigning of the "orientation lock" button in iOS 4.2 on the iPad by now enabling you to choose whether you want it to act as a silent switch or an orientation lock.</p>

<p>All of these changes are things I'd predicted but I'm really glad to see Apple have implemented them.  Video streaming over AirPlay and Hotspot on the iPhone are two great new features.  Roll on iOS 5.0!</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions about iOS 4.3, either get in touch via <a href="/contact/">email</a> or chat to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/bendodson">Twitter</a>.</p>

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2011/01/11/thoughts-on-the-verizon-iphone-4/">Thoughts on the Verizon iPhone 4</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2011-01-11" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/01/11/thoughts-on-the-verizon-iphone-4/">January 11, 2011</a></time>

			<p>Verizon have <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/iphone.jsp">just announced</a> that they'll be selling a CDMA version of the iPhone 4 from February 10th.  On the face of it, this news is only really exciting to US customers who don't like AT&T isn't it? Well, yes and no.  As an iPhone developer, this news is of great importance to me as more iPhones being sold means more people who can buy apps.  That's a good thing!  However, for everyone else, the Verizon iPhone 4 has some new features that may make it into the current GSM models of the iPhone.  It also points to some interesting changes possibly coming to iOS to combat the increasing functionality that Android offers.   
The iPhone 4 that has been shown today is different to the existing iPhone 4 in two key ways; an antenna redesign and a new "hotspot" feature.</p>

<h3>Antenna Redesign</h3>
<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/cdma-vs-gsm.jpg" alt="" title="iPhone 4: CDMA vs GSM" width="600" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-456" />

<p>In the photo I've put together above, the current GSM version of the iPhone 4 is on the left whilst the new CDMA version is on the right.  You can see on the old version that there are gaps for the antenna in the bottom corners of the phone and at the top next to the headphone jack.  On the new version, however, there are a total of 4 antenna breaks with one in each corner.  Not only does it look nicer, but I'm willing to bet it's been redesigned to fix the Antennagate problem that plaqued the iPhone 4 upon its release.  Now that a new case has been designed, it's not beyond reason to think that Apple might silently make any new iPhone 4s they are shipping use this new case design, especially if it improves performance.  Alternatively, I would expect the iPhone 5 to have the same basic design as the iPhone 4 but just have a speed boost internally (similar to the iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 3G) so this new design may be suitable for that.  Time will tell I suppose!</p>

<h3>Hotspot</h3>

<p>The most exciting news for most commentators is that the new iPhone 4 has a feature called Hotspot <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/11iphone.html">"allowing customers to use iPhone 4 to connect up to five Wi-Fi enabled devices"</a>.  This is something that Android has been doing for a little while and a feature I use frequently on my Nexus S.  With the current iPhone 4, you can tether via USB or Bluetooth but you generally have to pay extra for the privilege (which is a little excessive considering you've already paid for the data).  It hasn't been confirmed or denied by Apple, but I wonder if we might not see this functionality introduced worldwide by adding it to the next version of iOS.  I have long suspected that iOS would get an upgrade to 4.3 at some point in late January or February and so this would fit in well with the launch date of the new Verizon iPhone 4 (in that it could come bundled with iOS 4.3).  Complete conjecture for the time being but it's an interesting idea and shows that Apple is willing to go head to head with Android on features.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-4-will-have-3g-mobile-hotspot/">Engadget report</a> that the Verizon iPhone that they got to play with after the announcement was running a bespoke build of iOS 4.2.5 and that the Hotspot functionality is built into iOS as "Personal Hotspot".  I definitely think this is a contender for inclusion publicly in iOS 4.3</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/01/11/ios-4-3-to-bring-mobile-hotspots-to-gsm-iphones-pending-carrier-support/">Mac Rumors</a> is now reporting that iOS 4.3 will bring hotspot support to the GSM iPhone 4 but activating it will require carrier support (and potentially charges).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As I predicted, Apple have release iOS 4.3 to developers with the new hotspot functionality in place.  It replaces the existing internet tethering feature so still costs money on some carriers (alas).

			<p>I was recently reading through some of my old blog posts when I discovered an article that is still fairly popular about <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/09/08/control-mac-mini-from-iphone-with-waking-sleeping-audio-video/">controlling a mac mini via an iPhone</a>.  I had an old mac mini lying around and so installed it in my bedroom as a device which basically acted as an iTunes library and alarm clock.  Times have changed though and I no longer have a mac mini in my bedroom; I have an Apple TV.  With the recent news about iPhone alarm clocks failing to go off (again) and lots of hacking projects with AirPlay to try and stream more than just YouTube videos, I decided to work on something this evening I've been thinking about for a little while; turning my Apple TV into an Alarm Clock.  The basic idea is that at a set time in the morning, the Apple TV will wake itself up automatically and start playing a set playlist from my shared iTunes library.  The first step would be to get audio playlists working, but the ultimate goal would be to have video alarms as well.  Thanks to a bit of AppleScript, I've managed to cook up a basic app to do just that.</p>

<p>So, how does one go about creating an AirPlay Alarm Clock?  First of all, you will need a mac that is turned on with a shared iTunes library of content. The "turned on" bit can be automated from System Settings i.e. your machine can be asleep but told to wake up 5 minutes before your alarm is due to go off if you want to save energy.  You will also need an AirPlay compatible device - this can be a set of speakers plugged into an Airport Express, one of the new AirPlay compatible iHome speaker systems, or an Apple TV.  Please note that video playback will obviously only work on the Apple TV although you will get the audio from the video if you select an audio-only device.  Once you've got those, you'll need to make a small tweak to your OS X setup: if you go into System Preferences and then Universal Access, you'll need to enable access for assistive devices - this is so AppleScript can make keypresses on your behalf.</p>

<p>Ok, on to the code:</p>

<p>I'll explain all of that in a bit more detail shortly, but for those of you that want to get cracking, you can copy and paste that into the AppleScript Editor that comes free with every copy of OS X.  You'll want to tweak the first two lines so that the variables match the name of your device and your playlist.  Once that is done, you can save the script as an application.  To get the alarm to play automagically in the mornings, you can open up iCal and create a new event (it can be recurring if you want a daily alarm).  In the "alarm" section, there is a little known entry called "run script" which you can use to run an AppleScript at a specified time relative to the alarm.  If you choose the script you saved, then it will automatically run at the allotted time.  Simple!</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This script is currently set to shuffle your playlist so that you don't get the same song every morning.  However, if you want to playback video, you have to disable the shuffling as iTunes doesn't like playing shuffled video playlists over AirPlay for some reason.  To do that, you need to edit the 3rd line from the bottom in the AppleScript to say "<code>set shuffle of playlist PlaylistName to 0</code>".</p>

<p>If you're a geeky sort of person, you'll probably want to know how all of that script works.  Here is a quick breakdown of each section:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-applescript" data-lang="applescript"><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">AppleTVName</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Bedroom Apple TV&quot;</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">PlaylistName</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Alarm&quot;</span>

<span class="nb">activate</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">delay</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span>

<span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;System Events&quot;</span>
	<span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span>
		<span class="k">set</span> <span class="na">visible</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">front</span> <span class="nb">browser</span> <span class="na">window</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="no">true</span>
                <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="na">view</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">front</span> <span class="nb">browser</span> <span class="na">window</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nv">playlist</span> <span class="nv">PlaylistName</span>
	<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">tell</span>
	<span class="nb">delay</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The first step is to setup some variables in order to make it as easy as possible to change later on.  The first is the name of your device (as listed in iTunes) and the second is the name of your chosen playlist.  The next two lines tell iTunes to activate (basically open it if it's closed, or bring it to the front if it's already open) and then a short delay to make sure everything has caught up.  You'll notice the line "delay 0.2" in quite a lot of places in this code.  It is there to delay all activity by 0.2 seconds and is required as AppleScript can sometimes run quicker than the buttons it's pressing - by adding the delays every so often, it ensures that you aren't trying to access windows or menus which haven't yet appeared.  If the script isn't working for some reason and you have an old machine, try increasing the delay timeouts first of all as these are usually the culprit.  The next couple of lines force iTunes to make the main window prominent (in case we have any sub-windows hanging around) and also to display the playlist we want to play prominently.  The first version of this script didn't have that and everything generally worked fine so long as the last screen you looked at on iTunes was a music page.  I left a TV show list open and found it no longer worked (caused an error with the button handling) so I've added this section to ensure you are always on the correct page.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-applescript" data-lang="applescript"><span class="k">tell</span> <span class="na">window</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="nv">process</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span>
	<span class="nv">click</span> <span class="nb">button</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="na">window</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="nv">process</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;System Events&quot;</span>
	<span class="na">key code</span> <span class="mi">125</span> <span class="nv">using</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">command</span> <span class="nv">down</span><span class="p">}</span>
	<span class="nb">delay</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span>
	<span class="nv">keystroke</span> <span class="no">return</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This section controls the little AirPlay button in the bottom right hand corner of iTunes.  You can usually target buttons with their names rather than their index position but the AirPlay button is a special case as it has a different name depending on which device you have selected.  I have 4 different AirPlay devices in my house so rather than writing a big if statement to check for each name and then press accordingly, I instead target the button by it's numerical index.  You can find out the index of UI elements by using the fantastic <a href="http://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/">UI Browser</a> tool - it's a little bit pricey but worth the money if you are planning on doing a lot of AppleScripting.  Once we've told iTunes to click on the button, we use key code 125 (which means the down key) in conjunction with the command button to jump down the entire context list to the "Multiple Speakers..." option.  Originally, I wanted to read the list of devices, iterate through them, and then select the one we wanted but I had a lot of problems getting AppleScript to correctly read the context menu so went for this slightly more longwinded approach instead.  Once the "Multiple Speakers..." option is selected, we hit return to make it open the window.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-applescript" data-lang="applescript"><span class="k">tell</span> <span class="na">window</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Multiple Speakers&quot;</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="nv">process</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;System Events&quot;</span>
	<span class="nb">activate</span>
	<span class="nv">click</span> <span class="nb">button</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

		<span class="nb">activate</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This section is now specifically targeting the "Multiple Speakers" window which we just opened.  The activate command allows us to start interacting with it, and by using UI Browser, we find that button 2 is the maximum volume setting.  I decided to set this manually here (rather than using the existing volume) just in case I had it set really quiet (or muted) for any reason.  This ensures that the music will always come through at it's maximum volume.  The next section lets us select the table listing which shows each device that we are about to iterate through.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle of coding so you may wonder why there are two loops here which are essentially the same.  The first goes through the list and turns the checkbox on for the device we want to play our alarm through.  The second goes through the same list again, but turns off any devices that aren't our chosen alarm device.  My first thought was to do one loop that went through and turned the checkbox on if the device was correct or off it wasn't.  The problem with that approach is that you can't turn off the Computer audio until you've selected another device.  Therefore, you have to go through once to turn on the chosen device and then through again to turn the others (if they were enabled) off.  A little tedious but this is a bit hacky anyway!  I've updated the delay in the first loop from 0.2 to 0.5 as I found that a 0.2 delay would occasionally not be enough time for an AirPlay speaker to be selected before the next loop comes in and turns of the Computer.  This led to an alert in the script (thus pausing everything not leading to playback) which is obviously not ideal in an alarm clock...</p>

<p>Just for the sake of tidiness, this tell will close the "Multiple Speakers" window we opened.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-applescript" data-lang="applescript"><span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTunes&quot;</span>

	<span class="nb">play</span> <span class="nv">playlist</span> <span class="nv">PlaylistName</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">tell</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This final section tells iTunes to shuffle our playlist (remember to turn the shuffle off &mdash; set shuffle of playlist PlaylistName to 0 &mdash; if you are going to send video via AirPlay) and then play it.</p>

<p>And there you have it! A small piece of AppleScript to enable audio and video alarms over AirPlay.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update [11th Jan 2011]:</strong> I've amended two sections of the code.  Firstly, I've added a line near the top which ensures that the playlist you want to play is selected and displayed as the main view.  Previous versions worked perfectly when I tested them as I was in the "Music" section of iTunes but if you are in a video section (e.g. left on a TV show page) then there would be an error as it couldn't find the AirPlay button (as the index was different).  The second change is a delay in the looping section has been increased from 0.2 to 0.5 as occasionally it took slightly longer than 0.2 seconds to select an AirPlay speaker. This caused a problem as the script would alert causing everything to pause.  Both lines have been amended in the code at the top of the page and in the analysis afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Update [25th Oct 2011]:</strong> The button codes have changed in iTunes 10.4 and 10.5 so I've updated the above script so it will continue to work. The key part was changing <code>click button 8 of window "iTunes" of application process</code> to <code>click button 10 of window "iTunes" of application process</code>. Thanks to Thomas Engbjerg for letting me know it was broken!</p>

<p><strong>Update [25th Jan 2012]:</strong> I've added this code to <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/Apple-TV-Alarm-Clock">GitHub</a> for easier managing. If something should break in the future (looking at you iTunes 10.6) then a fix will be put up there.</p>

<p><strong>Update [15th Mar 2012]:</strong> iTunes 10.6 did break as expected - needed to add a <code>delay 0.2</code> before the call to speak with the <code>"Multiple Speakers"</code> window due to some newly introduced lag. Updated here and on <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/Apple-TV-Alarm-Clock">GitHub</a>.</p>

    	<div>
			<p>A few people have started asking me for my opinion on the fast-growing story about CoverSutra, a mac application for which the developer promised free updates until version 3.0 several years ago but then switched to be exclusive on the Mac App Store with a new 2.x version which old customers would have to rebuy.  I have mixed opinions about this but it gives me some scope to talk not only about the Mac App Store, but also about selling on the internet in general and the lack of understanding by a large amount of the commenting world.</p>

<p>Looking at the issue at hand first of all, it is essential that you go to the <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/blog/">Sophiestication Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/blog/coversutra-2-5/">read the article</a> that sparked this all off.  The basic details are that version 2.5 was a new update that was to be exclusive on the App Store yet this reneged on a previous promise (made several years ago apparently) that all updates would be free until version 3.0 - users that bought a version recently would now not be able to upgrade to 2.5 without paying $5 on the App Store.  At first glance, the fault would appear to lie with the developer and, to be fair, that is still my general opinion.  A lot of people have backed the developer purely because of the horrendous abuse that she has suffered on her blog (which I'll come to shortly) but that is to forgive something because of abuse after the fact which, in this case, is actually immaterial.  She promised a free update until version 3.0 and didn't deliver it so in a way people are allowed to be pissed especially when she remarks that "a migration from the previous standalone version is sadly not possible.... however I lowered the price to $4.99 so there's no reason not to pick up a copy for new features".  This was excaberated by her fanning the flames in the comments by telling everyone to "chill down" and so on.</p>

<p>As the comments got worse (and needlessly aggressive in tone), it became apparent that a lot of the problem was people not understanding why they couldn't get updates through the Mac App Store and that the developer had forgotten the previous promise that was made.  I'll come to the Mac App Store shortly but the issue of a promise could have been dealt with in a far more dignified way.  Upon being reminded about the promise, she should have instantly made a simple apology and outlined what had happened.  Instead, she told an already riled crowd to "calm down" and made the situation far worse.  In essence, the initial promise should never have been made.  Upon it's revelation, the 2.5 version should have been recompiled to be distributed through the Sparkle system she was using.</p>

<blockquote><p>It‘s true that I could have made version 2.5 available through the legacy Sparkle updater. But maintaining two builds, one for the App Store and one with the serial number checks, was too time consuming for me. Precious time better spend on the actual update and my other apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to disagree with this assessment.  I agree wholeheartedly that maintaining two distribution channels is difficult and, if I were to launch a mac application tomorrow, I would only choose the Mac App Store.  However, if you have an update system in place, there is not much effort involved to publish an update through it (as that is the essence of the system).  This does not mean she would need to sell version 2.5 on her website, just push an update through her existing system for the old users.  That would have solved all the problems and taken considerably less effort than it's now going to take to "restore sanity" to her users.</p>

<p>It's very easy at this point to blame the Mac App Store for this issue.  After all, if Apple allowed upgrade pricing then this wouldn't be happening.  I disagree with this also as the Mac App Store is not trying to be the all encompassing place for mac software as is highlighted by their terms of what is and isn't allowed in the store.  They are creating a store for certain kinds of apps sold in the way in which Apple sells its own apps.  iLife for example comes out almost every year but there is no upgrade pricing - it's priced cheap (for mass consumption) and a new version is something worth buying so you pay for it.  You don't pay for the *.x releases mid-cycle (as these are bug fixes and tiny new features) but the next version generally adds a great deal.  You could say "I've been a customer for x years - I <em>deserve</em> a lower price due to customer loyalty" but I don't think that's true.  This seems to be the same philosophy that Apple are trying to encourage in the Mac App Store, namely price your apps low but customers have to buy again when a new version comes out. Conversely, your version updates had better be good as your customers won't be happy if you put out a new version that they have to pay for again but doesn't add anything good.</p>

<p>Paying for new versions of things is something that we, as customers, should be used to.  After all, when Sonic the Hedgehog 2 came out on the Mega Drive, we didn't complain that we already owned Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and version 2 only added new levels and a new character so why should we pay full price?  You buy the next version again as it adds new things that you want.  This is exactly the same in desktop apps as it is for mobile apps or computer games.  The pricing actually becomes immaterial compared to the philosophy of "buy new versions of apps". If your app is priced well, then people will pay for the new version.  If they don't, then you got the money for the old version and you've learned that the features you added in your new version aren't actually as good as you thought they were.  Do some market research, start work on a new version, and hope that they'll pay next time.</p>

<p>This is something that we need to get used to.  As an app developer myself, it appalls me that people think that having paid $5 for an app they should get free upgrades for life.  That isn't sustainable, economical, or fair to developers.  However, the onus is also on us, the developers, to make each version so good that people will pay for $5 again for each new version.</p>

<p>So, going back to the CoverSutra story, I agree with the developer on one hand but disagree on the other; I agree that going the Mac App Store route is the best way and that each new version should be charged for separately.  I do disagree however with her going Mac App Store exclusive on updates for her previous customers when she had promised free upgrades for a certain period of time.  She didn't need to make that promise but she did (presumably to make more sales at the time) so those free updates need to happen.</p>

<p>My final thought on all this is about commenting on the internet in general.  As you may have noticed, my website has recently been redesigned and one of the features I've redeveloped is the blog.  It no longer has a commenting system.  This is by design as I've noticed the deterioration of comments over the last couple of years.  The facelessness of the internet means that people now act in a way that they wouldn't in a normal conversation.  The comments on Sophia's blog are nothing short of sickening regardless of the rights or wrongs of the decision taken and that is exactly one of the reasons why I won't let people comment on my blog anymore.  I've never attracted such aggression before but the fact that it seems to be slowly becoming the norm on the internet troubles me. If people want to reply to my blog posts, they can contact me on Twitter (where I can reply directly knowing that they've heard back from me - commenting systems don't always inform the commentator of a reply), post a reply on their own blog, or email me directly.  That way, they aren't anonymous (leading to more reasonable discourse) and I can reply back to them.</p>

<p>One of my big hopes for 2011 is that iTunes will add a "reply" feature to commentators so that we don't get the same level of abuse and stupid comments on the reviews of Mac and iPhone apps as that is going downhill currently - many people leave comments on apps saying "this doesn't work" but without the power to reply it's near impossible to let someone know a problem has been fixed.  Most developers do want to help and aren't trying to screw the customer over but with the anonymous reviews and comments left by the countless numbers of people with bad attitudes, it's very easy to stop caring about the customer.  I can't help but think that the whole CoverSutra thing wouldn't have exploded as much as it did if Sophia had comments disabled on her blog...</p>

			<time datetime="2011-01-07" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2011/01/07/my-take-on-microsofts-keynote-at-ces-2011/">January 07, 2011</a></time>

			<p>Tonight I did two things I didn't think would ever happen; I stayed up until 2:30am to watch Steve Ballmer give a presentation and I installed Silverlight on my Macbook Air.  Why you ask?  As someone in the "mobile development space", I felt it was my duty to not just focus on Apple's keynotes (fantastic though they are) and instead take a listen to a few other CEO's, especially when they could be announcing something important in the area of tablet PCs.  Last year, Steve Ballmer famously introduced "slates" to the world at a time when Apple hadn't yet launched a tablet and all the rumour blogs were pointing at the possible name for a new device being the iSlate.  It struck me then that by suddenly calling the tablets he was announcing slates (when nobody had previously) that Ballmer was just doing some showboating as he was launching something before Apple.  However, the iPad (I like to imagine Steve Jobs put out the iSlate name purely to fool Ballmer whilst all along knowing he was going to call it the iPad) launched shortly afterwards to international success.  In the year since, no other tablet has gained as much media attention or sales.  The HP slates that Ballmer announced at CES 2010 have conveniently never materialised.  So, I was curious to see if slates would be making a comeback and if we'd actually see an iPad-killer.  As an iPad developer, I thought it best that I see the competition as it happened rather than waiting until morning for the news.  </p>

<p>Aside from any tablet announcements, I was also curious about what was happening with Windows Phone 7 and any news about upcoming games for the Kinect.  I know very little about Windows Phone 7 (about from the UI looks a bit better than Android's) so any extra knowledge would be an asset.  The Kinect, on the other hand, is a device I've owned since day one and absolutely love - I'm just keen to know what they are bringing to it apart from fitness and dance games.</p>

<h3>Opening</h3>
<p>It's 2:30am. I refresh Safari and nothing. 2:35am. Nothing. 2:40am. Nothing.  Finally, at 2:47am, somebody from CES comes out after showing off a video to showcase CES that looks like it was made pre-2000.  It was a seriously bad video with the only indication it was new being that it had a song that's only just been in the charts as a backing track.  It was painful.  The only thing more painful was the guy introducing who seemed to speak corporate bullshit (I have no idea what half his sentences meant) and the odd reference to a book he'd written that he was trying to plug.  This was topped only by his introduction for Steve Ballmer in which he called the Microsoft CEO "focused".  In any case, the music started and we all expected Steve to come <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc">bounding out like a maniac as per usual</a>but he didn't.  I was genuinely surprised to find Steve behaving and sounding a little bit like a normal person throughout!  Anyway, he briefly talks about how successful Microsoft has been in the past year (let's face it, we needed reminding) and how he wanted to talk about Kinect, Windows Phone 7, and then Windows itself.  I'll give you my opinion of each in the same order.</p>

<h3>Kinect</h3>

<p>I love the Kinect. It's a fantastic device and some of the homebrew apps that people have written to use it have been <a href="http://vimeo.com/17095170">truly inspiring</a>.  For all that, the launch titles were fairly unimpressive with the most popular games being Kinect Adventures (that comes free with it), Dance Central (dance game from the people behind Rock Band), and Your Shape: Fitness Evolved (which has an amazing UI and gives you the socially awkward power of laughing at anyone who still uses Wii Fit).  However, this isn't gaming for the masses; this is trying to be a Nintendo Wii with an albeit better controller.  I should point out at this point that Steve did put a lot of emphasis into the marketing slogan of "You... are....... the................. controller" as if we haven't heard it a million times already.  Anyway, were we going to find out about some awesome new software for the Kinect.</p>

<p>Umm... no.</p>

<p>The first "big" announcement was that the Netflix interface would now be controllable with the Kinect. I already thought it was but then I'm not in the US so I don't get to see any Netflix interface!  Next up was that Hulu would be coming to the Kinect.  Now that is a good announcement, but alas, it's US only as well so not terribly exciting for me personally.  There was some talk about some more ESPN stuff including some very awkward "trash talk" about a college football game and then that was it for the live demo.  And then Steve came back onstage but this time in the form of his Xbox avatar in order to tell us about Avatar Kinect.  When I'd first heard the name Avatar Kinect about 3 hours before the presentation, I assumed it was going to be some amazing Kinect powered tie-in with the 3D film Avatar. How wrong I was!</p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/Avatar_Kinect_Tailgate_06_web-500x281.jpg" alt="" title="Avatar Kinect" width="500" height="281" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-431" />

<p>Avatar Kinect is a free piece of software that will be available in a future Xbox update.  It allows you to use your Xbox Avatar to talk to friends by putting you in a number of different settings with your friends Avatars (e.g. a news desk or a car park) where you can then chat or record movies, etc.  The technology is pretty clever in that it will do lip syncing and animate facial features (Steve showed this off with his eyebrows) but I can't help but feel that you'd use the app once to try it out and then never use it again.  Why would you chat with your friends through your avatar when you have a proper webcam built into the Kinect and the software to use it?  It was hardly earth-shattering news so the Xbox portion of the evening was pretty disappointing.</p>

<h3>Windows Phone 7</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, I don't know a huge amount about Windows Phone 7 so I was kind of looking forward to seeing this section to try and understand it a bit better.  The first thing that Steve points out is that the Windows Phone 7 is actually really good, it's just not very popular as people haven't seen it.  We are encouraged that by showing it to people, they really like it and thing it's better than other phones on the market.  This smacks of Project Mojave to me - to those that don't remember, Project Mojave was a Microsoft marketing experiment in which they tried to combat the negative tide of opinion about Windows Vista by putting focus groups together to try the next version of Windows (naming it Windows Mojave) but instead gave them Windows Vista.  This led to lots of video of people saying "this is great" and "so much better than Vista" before then being told the truth.  The end result was supposed to be that Vista is great and people need to use it rather than bitch about it but the actual feeling you got from it was that Microsoft has a real problem with it's marketing department.  This appears to be true of Windows Phone 7 as well if the only reason it isn't the biggest selling phone of the year is because people haven't used it or don't know about it.</p>

<p>In any case, now was the time to show it off.  So, did they do a Steve Jobs style gradual walkthrough or a nice video to show off it's strengths?  No.  They got a "chief goatherder for two, young, rambunctious kids" who seemed to be on some medical grade drugs to do it.  Words can't describe how off-putting Liz Sloan is so I'm just going to embed the 8 minute segment she did below.  If you can get through 30 seconds without wanting to scream then you did better than me.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rsl97vZHOJk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Firstly, her presentational style is such that I quickly forgot about the phone as I was concentrating on her so much trying to work out just what she was on.  That isn't good for a phone which is described as "a good phone if you show it to someone" as we weren't seeing the phone, just her.  Other things that riled me were that she thinks it's a "great phone for people like us" whilst talking to the audience but she actually means "people like her".  The audience wasn't made up of busy mums who want to get tasks done on their phone quickly - it was made up of tech nerds who were going to a 4 day conference about technology.  These are the kind of people that want to get lost in their phones every day and never come out.  In addition, her description of copy and paste (a feature which is a long time coming - yes, I know it took a while on the iPhone as well but you don't launch an "iPhone killer" without it) was borderline patronising and nearly every task she did I could do at the same speed on an iPhone or Android phone so I don't follow the supposed speed increase which she was talking about.  The stat of "5500 apps in our store" was also repeated far too much - that isn't a figure to be proud of.</p>

<p>The best piece for me though was a dig at Google that went all wrong.  Liz tried to point out that Bing on the Windows Phone 7 pushes the most relevant pieces to the top so you don't have to hunt around to find information.  The demonstration given was a search for "Miami Heat" which then showed the score from last night at the top of the search results "instead of a lot of blue links that then brings me to the answer" (read Google Search Results).  I thought this a little odd so I searched for "Miami Heat" in Google and, as I suspected, the scores for the last 3 games were shown right up top.  Liz passionately explains how this breakthrough (*cough*) also worked for things like stocks and weather which I'm pretty sure show up in Google in the same way as well (along with cinema times, maths calculations, and a host of other things).</p>

<p>All in all, the Windows Phone 7 segment was pretty terrible.  The highlight was probably Steve showing off how Xbox Live works on the phone and the announcement of a pinball game that connects with Fable 3 to give you gold.  This was however quickly marred by a video showing how great games are on Windows Phone 7 that mainly featured iOS games which have been ported...</p>


<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>And so we got to the final round; Windows itself.  Unfortunately Microsoft had already announced the biggest thing some 4 hours earlier which was that Windows was now being rebuilt to work on SoC processors (estimated time: 18-24 months) but that didn't stop them giving us another 15 minute demo of what that looks like.  Aside from that, there was very little to say.  A few laptops and tablets were briefly demoed and I'd like to talk about two of them which caught my eye; the <a href="http://www.acer.com/iconia/">Acer Iconia</a> and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/buy/featured/asus.aspx">ASUS EEE Slate EP121</a> (just rolls of the tongue that one).</p>

<p><strong>Acer Iconia</strong> - this new Windows 7 laptop looks a little like a large Nintendo DS due to it's dual screen setup but unlike the DS, both screens are touch-enabled.  The demo looked ok apart from a few UI issues such as tapping the tilted screen (remember Steve Jobs saying how they'd never do this as every time they tested it people hated it?) and having a folder stretch over both screens leading to a big plastic bar half way between your viewing area.  However, the thing that irritated me the most was the gesture to bring up the onscreen keyboard.  Since seeing the demo, I've asked a few people "what do you think Microsoft would choose a suitable gesture for bringing up a keyboard"?  Most people said a swipe up or even a two or three fingered swipe in a direction.  Instead, Microsoft decided that a 10-fingered gesture (must be the world's first) was best - you have to push all 10 of your digits onto the lower screen at the same time to bring up the keyboard.  Without having used the Iconia myself I can't really comment on how it works but I can't imagine that typing on a glass display is going to be particularly good for long usage.  The iPad is great but you wouldn't use it to type an essay and entering any text is really a bit of a chore - I would hate to have that as my main input option on what is supposed to be a fully fledged PC, not just a tablet for light app usage.  Having said that, it's a very different concept and I'm going to be interested to see consumer feedback on the dual-screen approach.</p>

<p><strong>ASUS EEE Slate EP121</strong> - This was the main tablet that was shown off and is actually a full PC inside a 12.1" tablet form factor. It's running an Intel Core i5 and can have upto 4 gigs of RAM in it.  They seem to have hedged their bets for input methods by bundling it with both a wireless keyboard and a stylus but you can also use normal touch and a virtual keyboard.  The thing that struck me was a) it looks heavy and too bulky to be a convenient tablet and b) the input methods don't look good.  If you have a tablet, you shouldn't need a physical keyboard.  Yes, you can get them for the iPad but why would you?  If you need to do a lot of typing you are probably better off with a real laptop rather than a tablet device.  The demo showed an excel spreadsheet being controlled with touch at one point (with a pinch gesture to zoom) and then using a stylus to edit a spreadsheet.  I can't imagine anything worse than trying to fill in a spreadsheet on a 12.1" tablet with a stylus but there you are. I haven't used it, so again I'm speculating, but I have a feeling that this device is going to get very hot and run out of battery very quickly (they say 3+ hours on their website!).  For $100 less than the asking price (which is $1,099), you could get an 11" MacBook Air with a higher screen resolution, longer battery, far less weight, and a much smaller form factor.  A MacBook Air could also run Windows 7 if that's what you want!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The keynote ended with a look at the Microsoft Surface which is now in a smaller form factor, is slightly cheaper,  and has support for 20 fingers in multitouch gestures rather than 10. That was pretty much all I could glean about it!  I do like the Surface but I wish they'd spent as much time as they have on that working on a truly mobile tablet OS rather than trying to shoehorn Windows 7 onto every device.  Windows 7 may be good for some tasks (I don't like it personally) but it is not a suitable OS for a tablet in the same way that OS X wouldn't have worked on a tablet.  Android made a similar decision when they tried to put a mobile phone OS onto a tablet.  Apple made the right choice by making an optimised OS for it and that is why it has succeeded and other tablets have failed (although it will be interesting to see how the new Android 3.0 UI, supposedly optimised for tablets, will work out).</p>

<p>Overall I was pretty disappointed with the Microsoft Keynote.  Sure there were some interesting ideas being floated with the dual-screen Acer laptop and the Windows for SoC announcement but the majority was just rehashing things that have already been demoed or shown off in the past and irritating people showing off features that most mobile phones now have. Microsoft have a lot of catching up to do in the mobile world and I think this year is going to hit them pretty hard. </p>

			<p>Over the last 14 years, I have witnessed the internet expanding rapidly and becoming massively commercialised. With this kind of rampant upscaling, there is always a point at which there are enough people using the system that want to exploit it in some way, usually for monetary gain. With the internet, this has been done rather crudely with the invent of <strong>spam email</strong>. There are large numbers of servers whose primary aim is to crawl the internet searching for an email address. They then generate a list of these email addresses and sell them to companies who will send out mass emails trying to entice people to buy something or other.</p>

<p>As this problem has increased (apparently over 85% of all emails sent are spam), web developers have panicked and come up with all sorts of stupid methods to try and prevent it. Most developers won’t output their email address in plain text on a website (or with a mailto link) but instead choose to try and hide it by doing something along the lines of “ben [at] bendodson [dot] com”. This is highly inaccessible and is a real pain to try and decipher sometimes – and besides, a human spammer could read it anyway! Other developers will set up a contact form and then protect it by means of a Captcha system or some other horrendously inaccessible device. These systems are incredibly difficult and time-consuming for able-bodied people to use let alone those with poor eye sight or other disabilities. Even so, these systems have become prevalent across the internet and show no signs of slowing down. Some contact forms now ask basic mathematic questions to prove you’re human completely over looking the fact that every one of these systems can eventually be thwarted as spam-bot developers adapt to them.</p>

<p>The real problem I have with all of these systems is that they impose limits on web users and slow them down.

			<p>Last Thursday, I expanded my <a href="http://gowallatools.com/">Gowalla Tools</a> website (a companion site for the popular geo-location game <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>) to include a new feature known as the Item Finder.  It works by displaying a list of spots in any area you choose, and them removing those that don't have items you are missing from your vault.  I always knew that this would be a controversial feature and that I'd need to write a piece explaining why I had built it - now that a few people have complained that it is "changing the core nature of the game", it is probably an apt time to publish my opinion on why this is not the case.</p>

<p>Ever since I began work on my Gowalla Tools project, people have consistently been in contact to ask me to make an item finder.  They were frustrated that it seemed so difficult to find existing items in their areas when they were so abundant in other areas.  For example, in the UK it's very difficult to find a "Cowboy Hat" as these are only available in spots marked as "Saloons" (of which we have very few).  However, a few of these rare items have made it to our shores thanks to random items being seeded into new packs (meaning new players have a chance of having a rare item such as this available to them from the start) which are then dropped at locations to make them founded spots.</p>

<p>In the first version of Gowalla Tools, I added a feature which allowed you to see what items were available at any spot you chose.  This was not exactly game changing as you could work this out yourself on the Gowalla website by seeing what items had been dropped and picked up until you ended up knowing what was there - my site simply did it faster.  When I was initially asked to add a search feature, I was hesitant as I felt it took a lot away from the game and made it simply an item collection game similar to Packrat (which is how the vast majority of players came to find Gowalla) rather than a game about going to places.  I actually felt so strongly about changing the game into item collection that I edited the first draft so that items appeared in a popup window rather than inline - this meant it took a good 3 seconds or so before you could view the items at a spot and thus made it so that you couldn't just click around and see what was there.  Aside from my issues around gameplay, there were technical constraints as searching that many spots would place heavy demand on both mine and Gowalla's servers so I ruled it out.</p>

<p>It was a month or so later that I suddenly started to hit a brick wall with items.  I was missing around 10 items all of which were proving to be incredibly elusive as they were created mainly for the Texas area (e.g. Longhorn).  I realised I was spending a lot of time on the Gowalla Tools map clicking around trying to find out what items were available in my area and found quite a few items I had been missing that way.  Gowalla also stepped up their game and introduced version 1.3 of their app which allowed you to vault items from within the application - they were starting to take items more seriously so my site needed to do similarly.</p>

<p>I started to get underway with a brand new site and introduced the <strong>13 days of Gowalla Tools Christmas</strong> - a daring attempt to build 13 new tools for the site within the 25 days leading up to Christmas.  The first tool was obvious to me; the map needed to be radically overhauled and easier to search and view spots.  I improved the item offering quickly by showing you what items were at a spot and highlighted those items that were missing from your vault.  On day 2, I added the item search.  It didn't work the same way as many people had hoped (e.g. type in "Longhorn" and it'll show you all the spots that exists) due to the technical constraints.  However, it did allow you to load all the spots in your area and then remove all but those that had items you needed.</p>

<p>Initial feedback was excellent and I had felt that my compromise between ease of use and item searching had been well balanced.  However, I was recently alerted to a <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/gowalla/topics/friend_only_spots#reply_1644265">post</a> on <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/gowalla/">GetSatisfaction</a> (and several tweets) that felt that the new feature was game changing for Gowalla and was tantamount to cheating.</p>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p>My main reason for playing Gowalla is nothing to do with items - it's about finding new places and visiting those places.  It's about finding interesting spots in your neighbourhood that you may never have known were there and then going out and visiting them.  In my opinion, items were added in order to lure more people from Packrat and to make it seem more like a game but the key thing is locations.  Yes it could be perceived that the Gowalla Tools Item Finder makes it unfair to those that knew where items were previously who are now unable to get them as somebody else has now found them, but that's all part of the game.  You can't pick up items unless you are checked in at a location so if you don't go there, you can't have it.  If someone else gets there first, then the item is theirs!</p>

<p>The one thing that has annoyed me from the start about Gowalla is the rights that people have given themselves in terms of "that item is mine" or "I'm going to create that spot so you can't".  There are no "rules" in Gowalla apart from "first come, first served".  The claim that this is game changing is ruled out completely by the fact that Gowalla are fully aware of the Gowalla Tools website and support it (with many of their developers retweeting and using the functionality).  I speak with the developers frequently to let them know when I'm releasing new tools that I feel conflict with the core gameplay or could interfere with their servers (e.g. by placing too much demand).  I would of course remove any tool they felt violated these rules and as yet no request has been made - only encouragement  to do more!</p>

<p>On the positive side, there are a lot of people using the Item Finder in the way I intended.  I received a lot of tweets yesterday from people thanking me as they had found an item at a spot and were now going their specially to get it.  Some people were travelling up to an hour out of their way to get an item and I think that's great!  They were playing the game, going outside to new places rather than waiting and hoping that nobody would know an item they would quite like was there.</p>

<p>The item Finder does not change the core gameplay of Gowalla in any way - it adds to it by showing you spots that are of interest to you.  There are people who are affected (namely those on the Android platform) but unfortunately that is a shortcoming on Gowalla's part in not implementing the same level of gameplay for all users.  They shouldn't have launched the Android version without all the core game components but this does not mean that Gowalla Tools should be limited.  There are several people on devices that can't play Gowalla who would like to - should we horde items away for them?  Of course not!  Items can still be obtained in the traditional ways and as yet they aren't limited to batches in the same way Packrat items are so I don't see the problem.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks I'll be releasing more tools that push forward this key feature of getting out there and discovering new places and todays new tool (Flickr Integration) hopefully expands this more by giving you more visual information about a place before you get there.  I stick firmly by my decision to release the item finder and I hope that the majority of you will agree with me.</p>

<p>Now get out there and start Gowalla'ing!</p>

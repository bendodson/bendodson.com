			<time datetime="2016-04-26" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/04/26/emoji-flags-from-iso-3166-country-codes-in-swift/">April 26, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>I‚Äôm working on a personal project currently that works heavily with country codes and the selection of countries. To make it look better, I wanted to use a flag icon for each country in the list. In the past, this would have been done with a load of imported images named something like ‚Äúgb.png‚Äù but luckily there is a modern solution; emoji!</p>

<p>As of iOS 9.0, every ISO 3166-1 country now has a corresponding emoji flag<sup id="fnref:flags"><a href="#fn:flags" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The way to build them is also incredibly simple as you basically put the two letters together as joined Unicode characters. <a href="https://esham.io/2014/06/unicode-flags">Benjamin Esham explains it</a> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What they did is both crazy and genius. Instead of assigning a codepoint to each flag, which is the obvious way to do it (and the way the rest of the emoji are encoded), the standard defines twenty-six ‚Äúregional indicator symbols‚Äù, from U+1F1E6 REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER A to U+1F1FF REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER Z. In order to include a country‚Äôs flag in your text, you first look up the country‚Äôs two-letter ISO 3166-1 code and then write the two regional indicator symbols corresponding to those letters. A font with support for that flag treats the two-codepoint sequence as a ligature, replacing the combination with a single pictogram.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let‚Äôs take the United States as an example. Its ISO 3166-1 two-letter code is ‚Äúus‚Äù, so we need to use the codepoints U+1F1FA REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U and U+1F1F8 REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER S. Combining these gives a symbol that renders in your browser as üá∫üá∏.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armed with this information, it is easy to write a basic function to turn a code like ‚Äúus‚Äù into the corresponding flag emoji:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">emojiFlag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">countryCode</span> <span class="nl">countryCode</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">country</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">countryCode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">uppercaseString</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">uS</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">country</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">unicodeScalars</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UnicodeScalar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">127397</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">uS</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">string</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>A great way of testing this is with an Xcode Playground which will allow you to quickly see the output like such:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/flag-playground.jpg" width="800" height="419" /></p>

<p>If you use an incorrect code such as ‚Äúen‚Äù<sup id="fnref:england"><a href="#fn:england" class="footnote">2</a></sup> then you‚Äôll be given back the letters within boxes.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/flag-emoji-from-country-code">download my example playground from GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:flags">
      <p>Most were supported in iOS 8.3 but hidden from the emoji keyboard; iOS 9.0 added an extra 40 to complete the set including such places as Antarctica and Taiwan. They also added support for the EU flag. <a href="#fnref:flags" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:england">
      <p>England is not an iOS 3166-1 country and so there is no ‚Äúen‚Äù code. There is a proposal for subdivisions to be supported so something like ‚Äúgb-eng‚Äù would work but it is not accepted yet and iOS has no flags for places like England, Wales, or Scotland. <a href="#fnref:england" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<time datetime="2016-04-23" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/04/23/iphone-7-headphone-predictions/">April 23, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>I don‚Äôt tend to make many Apple predictions but I‚Äôve been meaning to write about the rumour of the lack of a headphone port on the iPhone 7 for some time. It seems almost certain that the iPhone 7 will drop the 3.5mm headphone jack in favour of using the proprietary lightning port and this has caused a lot of consternation in the tech press. This is understandable as there are several issues with doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You wouldn‚Äôt be able to use headphones you already own (potentially very expensive headphones).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you were using lightning headphones, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to charge your phone at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst Bluetooth is an option, it can have lag (only annoying on video) and you have to remember to charge them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The solution to the first problem is very simple; there will be an adapter accessory<sup id="fnref:adapterprice"><a href="#fn:adapterprice" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to allow you to plug 3.5mm headphones into the lightning port. I personally don‚Äôt have a problem with this; if you have expensive headphones and an expensive phone, the cost of buying an adapter is negligible really and it is unlikely to add any bulk as it‚Äôll just be extending the cord that you‚Äôll already be using. You are unlikely to buy an adapter to use the existing bundled EarPods as it is certain that Apple would bundle in some lightning powered EarPods so really the adapter is for those with existing expensive 3.5mm based headphones.</p>

<p>However, the other two issues are more problematic. There is an issue that you may very well want to charge your iPhone whilst listening to music via headphones and Bluetooth does suck when you are watching video as it is often out of sync by a few milliseconds. I own a pair of Beats Studio Wireless which connect either via Bluetooth or via a 3.5mm cable; I regularly use the cable when watching Netflix in bed as I find the lag incredibly irritating<sup id="fnref:audiolag"><a href="#fn:audiolag" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. In addition, I can charge my phone at the same time.</p>

<p>Some people have proposed that the iPhone 7 could get conductive charging much like the Apple Watch but this seems highly unlikely to me; the amount of space required to do that is huge (compared to a 3.5mm jack) and it charges very slowly, especially with an iPhone 6 Plus sized battery.</p>

<p>I have two predictions which I believe solve these issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The bundled headphones will be lightning but will have some sort of lightning passthrough so you can continue to power your device or use any other lightning accessory at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be wireless headphones that will work with some new proprietary sync method<sup id="fnref:airplay"><a href="#fn:airplay" class="footnote">3</a></sup> but can also work with a lightning cable for both listening and charging. They would be called ‚ÄúAirPods‚Äù and would either be bundled as the lightning headphones or be available separately for something like ¬£79 / $99. A <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/21/apple-wireless-headphones-lightning-headphones/">recent patent</a> that was unearthed would seem to indicate this as a solid option. Extra points to Apple if it is a custom wireless solution and it works with the Apple Watch 2.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these proposals get around the charging issue and the Bluetooth lag issue. I think it more likely that we‚Äôll get basic lightning headphones included and then have to pay for the fancier lightning / wireless ones but it isn‚Äôt outside the realm of possibility that they could be bundled. That said, I also wouldn‚Äôt put it past Apple to say ‚Äúyou can use headphones or you can charge your phone‚Äù similar to the ‚Äúcharge or use peripheral‚Äù attitude to the solo USB-C port on the MacBook<sup id="fnref:macbook"><a href="#fn:macbook" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The only thing that seems certain is that the 3.5mm port will not be available; you‚Äôll need to use either an adapter or whatever new headphones Apple release.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:adapterprice">
      <p>Likely priced at $29.99 / ¬£24.99 because they can. You‚Äôll get a cheap version on Amazon for $9.99 / ¬£6.99 within a month. <a href="#fnref:adapterprice" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:audiolag">
      <p>I couldn‚Äôt care less about audio lag for listening to music or podcasts as it really doesn‚Äôt matter and isn‚Äôt noticeable; it only affects video as 50ms of lag will mean that the actors lips don‚Äôt move precisely with their voice which is offputting. <a href="#fnref:audiolag" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:airplay">
      <p>They would probably use the ‚ÄúAirPlay‚Äù brand. <a href="#fnref:airplay" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:macbook">
      <p>Which I own and have had no issues with. Interesting that it retains a 3.5mm jack though when a USB-C port on both sides would make more sense to my mind. <a href="#fnref:macbook" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/clinix.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>I worked with <a href="http://clinix.co.uk/">Clinix</a> throughout 2015 as the exclusive iOS developer on their medical app. Clinix is a doctor-patient video consultation platform targeted primarily at the NHS. It provides patients with an Electronic Medical Records system that syncs automatically with their GP records. You can view and update allergies, medical history, and medications as well as make video appointments with your GP.</p>

<p>The app was built using Swift and interfaces with the OpenTok video APIs. I helped with the initial design of the PHP-based API and was integral in making UX decisions throughout the app.</p>

<p>Clinix is a free app and is <a href="https://appstore.com/clinix">available on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/connectingtohost.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>Connecting To Host is a (mostly) weekly podcast where we discuss video games from a strictly co-op / multiplayer point of view. We‚Äôve released three episodes today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>FORCED</em>: Specifically built for co-operative action, FORCED is an arcade RPG which takes you through a number of challenging arenas. Join us and find out more about ‚ÄúThe Orb‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarking up Enemies‚Äù, two strong mechanics that make FORCED a fun little online game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Torchlight II</em>: Join us as we talk about our co-operative experience working through Torchlight II, an action RPG developed by Runic Games that was originally released at the end of 2012.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Titanfall</em>: With the recent announcement of Titanfall 2 for Xbox One, PC, and PS4, we thought we would go back in time and talk about the original Titanfall and what it brought to the multiplayer shooter genre.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm really excited about this podcast and think it‚Äôll be a great way for people to get co-op specific reviews from two long time game players who spend several hours a week playing online together.</p>

    	<div>
			<p>Today I spent a little bit of time making a new iPhone message tone<sup id="fnref:hanoldbuddy"><a href="#fn:hanoldbuddy" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and it reminded me of how terrible the entire ringtone system is on iOS. I have a number of specific issues:</p>

<p><strong>Overpriced</strong> - most ringtones cost the same as a full song despite the fact they are shorter than the free preview on iTunes or they are a couple seconds of audio from a TV show or film. The pricing hasn‚Äôt changed since the ringtone store was launched in iOS 3 but the quality has definitely deteriorated with a number of dubious looking alert tones ripped from TV shows or YouTube videos.</p>

<p><strong>DRM</strong> - as well as being shorter than a full song for the same price, they are subject to DRM whereas music is not. They‚Äôre also in a proprietary format so you can‚Äôt re-use them on non-Apple devices.</p>

<p><strong>iTunes</strong> - you can create your own ringtones using GarageBand<sup id="fnref:garagebandmac"><a href="#fn:garagebandmac" class="footnote">2</a></sup> but the only way to get them onto your iPhone or iPad is to do a sync with iTunes. Eugh! We were supposed to have moved away from this when iOS 6 cut the iTunes cord but I couldn‚Äôt find any other way to get the *.m4r file over to iOS (I tried messaging it to myself and using Dropbox but neither option allowed you to then save it to your settings).</p>

<p><strong>iCloud</strong> - for some bizarre reason, ringtones are not synced via iCloud in the UK so if you haven‚Äôt backed them up you‚Äôll lose them when setting up a new device. There is no option to redownload them from iTunes and if you purchase one you‚Äôve previously downloaded you will be charged (you don‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúyou‚Äôve previously purchased this‚Äù dialogue like you do with music, tv shows, and movies). I‚Äôve purchased a few tones in the past<sup id="fnref:tones"><a href="#fn:tones" class="footnote">3</a></sup> but none of them are available to me unless I pay again.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have a solution to this (apart from killing the ringtone store and allowing you to just use MP3 files) but it is an area of the iOS ecosystem that is definitely showing it‚Äôs age. At the moment, you either have the expense and DRM protected (with no redownloads) way of purchasing or you can jump through hoops making your own and trying to get them onto your device. I‚Äôm not sure how either is seen as acceptable.</p>

  <p>My degree was in Politics and Philosophy so it shouldn‚Äôt have been a straightforward transition into the development industry. However, a few months after graduating, I found an advert for a job on Gumtree, interviewed in London, and then was given the job the day after.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My first job in the industry was as a Junior Developer for a digital agency in London and I worked on website code (HTML, PHP, and JavaScript). Within a few months, I was promoted to Senior Developer and then Development Manager in charge of the entire department due to a combination of constant learning (I read a ton of coding and management books) and people leaving the company. A year or so later, I moved to basically the same job at a different agency but I didn‚Äôt enjoy it - too many meetings, not enough actual work!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was around that time (early-2009) that the App Store was gaining traction and I was starting to tinker with iOS development in my spare time. I made the decision to quit my job and go freelance and I‚Äôve been doing it ever since. The actual step of going freelance was as simple as buying 2 books on app development (which were leaving presents from my previous job) and updating my website where I was already doing a bit of web development freelance on the side. My ‚Äúbig break‚Äù happened a few weeks later when Channel 4 asked me to appear on the Gadget Show and build an app for them - I agreed (despite having no clue what I was doing) and that helped me get more hits to my website and pick up some big clients like Sainsburys.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm often keen to go out and get some more qualifications but I don‚Äôt need them. My degree is in Politics and Philosophy but I‚Äôve never lost a client because I wasn‚Äôt qualified - a good portfolio to show you have the skills is worth more than any qualification.</p>

  <p>My wife has to head off to work at around 7am, so we typically get up just after 6am. As soon as she‚Äôs gone and I‚Äôve finished clearing up breakfast, I‚Äôll head into my home office and try and get a few development tasks done for my current client before checking email. I‚Äôll typically break at around 9-10am to check email and update my todo list for the day and then I‚Äôll continue on coding until lunchtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like to get out of the house every day and so I‚Äôll usually go for a walk after lunch and then do any non-development tasks that need doing; I tend to be tired in the afternoons so I get easier stuff done like replying to emails, doing my accounts etc - it‚Äôs not a good idea to do coding when you‚Äôre tired! My wife will get home around 5pm so I typically stop work at 4pm and play on the Xbox for a bit before she gets back.</p>

  <p>When I had an online game that I managed (WallaBee), I used to work pretty much every evening and at weekends as most of my players were based in the US. Since I sold that business, I strictly do work from 7am-4pm on weekdays and I rarely check or reply to email outside of those hours. It has been a huge improvement to have that work/life balance back and means I typically get more done in my working hours as I‚Äôm refreshed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two key things in my opinion; creativity and good time keeping. Developers need to be incredibly logical, but I find that you‚Äôll do better the more creative you are, as you‚Äôll typically find solutions to problems more quickly (and the majority of development work is problem solving). Good time keeping is essential, especially as a freelancer, as you need to be able to accurately say how long something will take so you can get paid fairly but also so you don‚Äôt end up with more work than you can actually do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a Development Manager, I interviewed around 150 people (70 of them for one job). I only look for one thing in an interview; potential. Development is a rapidly evolving business and so the way that things are done can change quickly; I always wanted to hire people who could adapt and that wanted to learn rather than those that looked good on paper but then were stuck doing something a certain way. In 3 years, I don‚Äôt think I ever hired someone with a degree in Computer Science for that reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-qualifications-do-people-in-your-sector-typically-have">What qualifications do people in your sector typically have?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most people will have a degree in Computer Science (or similar) but I think this is pointless. Most institutions will be teaching something that is already several years old and buy the time you come to get a job the technology will be outdated. I personally prefer to hire interesting people that have a lot of extra-curricular activity on their CV than someone with a degree. The best thing I did at university was to join lots of societies and start learning coding to build their websites; that gave me a portfolio I could get an actual job with.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In terms of app development, more and more people are self-learning and so you don‚Äôt need a degree at all, especially if you are going to freelance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Absolutely - my own progression from Junior Developer to Development Manager (in the space of a year) was nothing to do with time at the company or ticking boxes, it was purely based on demonstrating I could do the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my favourite anecdotes is something I started doing after my promotion to Senior Developer. The kitchen in our office was on the top floor next to the Sales Team and so whenever I‚Äôd go and get a cup of tea I‚Äôd chat to them and ask how their deals were going. One guy was showing me all his stats and pipeline deals and then stopped and said ‚Äúwait, you‚Äôre not my boss!‚Äù - I smiled and said ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point was that after a short period of time, I was able to appear more like a manager and this ended up with me getting a management job relatively quickly. Another important factor was that I used to spend a lot of time reading books about management whilst commuting. This helped as, once I had a team to manage, I already had a lot of systems to put in place to demonstrate I could do the job.</p>

  <p>It really depends on the company you work for. As a freelancer, I have an awful lot of time as I choose when I work (and if I decide I want the day off, I just do it). When I worked for a company, there was no reason you couldn‚Äôt do all of these things but I had a fairly long commute which limited my free time.</p>

  <p>It can do although I prefer not to do too much; I rarely meet my clients in person as I find that working in their office or travelling for meetings is a waste of my time. Most of my current clients are based in the US which is great as then I only have to do the occasional Skype call - my favourites are the ones that I just speak with via email.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That said, I have travelled to Norway, Sweden, and Spain in order to meet with clients or do presentations at conferences. There is a lot of potential for travel in the industry especially to the US.</p>

Are people in your industry underpaid, overpaid, or fairly paid?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think most people in my industry are overpaid. It‚Äôs very easy to drag a project out for a very very long time and get paid a large daily rate, especially when working for a large client. I had a lucrative contract with a big brand that was being paid at ¬£500 per day and after 3 days of nothing but meetings I quit. They hired someone else and after 8 months they released an app that was utterly terrible and would take a developer around 1 week to build. Nice work if you can get it, but it‚Äôs not for me, which is why I won‚Äôt take on a project longer than 2 months.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There‚Äôs actually two sides to it, depending on if you are working for a client or building your own apps. If you are doing client work, business is booming; everybody wants an app at the moment and so there are plenty of contracts available. However, if you want to build your own apps, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to get recognised and very hard to charge the right price so you can recoup your development costs. It can be a real struggle.</p>

  <p>I started off doing app development thanks to the Apress series of development books - they were excellent at the time but I feel you‚Äôd be better off using online tutorials nowadays.

  <p>Ignore everyone and do what excites you. There is no point in getting into an industry if you‚Äôre not passionate about it - if you are adaptable and willing to learn, you‚Äôll succeed.

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2016/03/23/homekit-wink-and-canary/">HomeKit, Wink, and Canary</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2016-03-23" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/03/23/homekit-wink-and-canary/">March 23, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>A couple of weeks ago I took the plunge and bought a <a href="https://canary.is">Canary</a>, an internet-connected personal security camera and air quality monitoring system. It has been working great so far and comes with a decent iPhone app that allows you to control the camera and have it activate automatically based on location. There are three different operating modes; armed, disarmed, and privacy. Whilst armed, you‚Äôll get a notification when any activity is detected whereas disarmed will still record and store any video when there is motion but it won‚Äôt notify you<sup id="fnref:disarmed"><a href="#fn:disarmed" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Privacy completely shuts off the camera and microphone.</p>

<p>For the simple reason that I don‚Äôt want everything that happens in my living room whilst I‚Äôm in it to be streamed to a 3rd party server, I have set the iPhone app to switch between armed and privacy modes; this means that if nobody is in the house, it automatically arms itself but will shut off the camera and microphone as soon as a family member gets back home. The problem with this is that the camera is then in privacy mode when we go to bed as obviously our phones are still in the house; if somebody breaks in, we won‚Äôt have any video evidence. I can open the iOS app and manually arm the Canary but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod%27s_law">Sod‚Äôs Law</a> means I‚Äôll probably get an intruder on the night I forget to do that<sup id="fnref:morning"><a href="#fn:morning" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My first thought was a scheduling system could be put in place to automatically arm and disarm the Canary if I‚Äôm in the house but the app doesn‚Äôt have that functionality and there is no public API. I then discovered that Canary have partnered with <a href="http://www.wink.com">Wink</a>, a platform that allows multiple devices to connect together so you can do things like have the lights turn on when motion is detected. This is really useful and does allow for the sort of scheduling I‚Äôd envisioned, but then I came up with a better solution; tying it into my existing HomeKit routine.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/01/homekit-christmas-tree-with-siri/">blogged about HomeKit before</a> and specifically about <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">Homebridge</a> which allows you to get non-HomeKit enabled devices to work with the system. Canary is not a HomeKit enabled device and with no open API it wasn‚Äôt possible for me to write a plugin. However, Wink does have an <a href="https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-wink">existing Homebridge plugin</a> allowing you to control most devices connected to Wink via HomeKit. Unfortunately, HomeKit doesn‚Äôt support cameras and so neither does that Wink plugin. Back to the drawing board!</p>

<p>After a bit of tinkering, I realised I could just re-purpose an existing supported HomeKit protocol; locks. In HomeKit, locks are basic binary operators that are either ‚Äúsecured‚Äù or ‚Äúunsecured‚Äù. This works perfectly for my Canary as I could denote it as a doorlock and then have ‚Äúsecured‚Äù equal ‚Äúarmed‚Äù, and ‚Äúunsecured‚Äù equal ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù. After a few minutes, I managed to fork the existing plugin and create a <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/homebridge-wink">new version with this hack in place</a>. Once downloaded, you just need to add the following platform in your Homebridge config file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;platform&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;homebridge-wink.Wink&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Wink&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;client_id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;quirky_wink_android_app&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;client_secret&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;e749124ad386a5a35c0ab554a4f2c045&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;YOUR-WINK-USERNAME-HERE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;YOUR-WINK-PASSWORD-HERE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;hide_groups&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[],</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;hide_ids&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><em>(Sidenote: most of my time tonight was spent trying to find a client_id and client_secret to use for the config. To get these, you usually have to email Wink with response times being around 7-10 days. I decided to rip it out of the Android app instead‚Ä¶)</em></p>

<p>Once you restart Homebridge, any of your Canary devices in Wink should show up in HomeKit automatically. You can then say something like ‚ÄúHey Siri, lock the living room‚Äù to arm the Canary. I personally like to use HomeKit scenes which allow me to control the Canary automatically with my existing ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and ‚Äúgood night‚Äù Siri phrases. I find this much more reliable than a schedule as I already use these phrases every time I go to bed and wake up in order to turn my lights on and off (whereas a schedule might turn the camera on whilst we‚Äôre still awake or turn it off before we get up).</p>

<p>Hopefully in the future we‚Äôll see a public API for Canary and support for cameras in HomeKit so I can make this slightly less hacky but it works for now and means I‚Äôll no longer forget to disable privacy mode at night. If you‚Äôre interested in trying this setup yourself, <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/homebridge-wink">check out the plugin on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<time datetime="2016-01-13" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/">January 13, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>Over the years Apple has put a lot of effort into making iOS secure and privacy focussed. You are prompted with dialogue boxes whenever an app tries to access your contacts, calendars, photos, or location and you need to confirm that you want to receive notifications. However, whilst developing <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/">Music Tracker</a><sup id="fnref:musictracker"><a href="#fn:musictracker" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I discovered that there is no privacy prompt when a developer tries to access your library. In fact, they can access all of your music data as simply as this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">MPMediaQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">songsQuery</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">query</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">items</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    	<span class="n">NSLog</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Title: \(item.title)&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>That’s just a basic example that’ll output the title of every song in your library but there is a lot of danger in that. This process happens completely silently and in my tests I was able to loop through a library of 10000 songs, put all the metadata in a JSON file<sup id="fnref:json"><a href="#fn:json" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, and upload it to a server in under 2 seconds!</p>

<p>But why is this a security or privacy risk? Off the top of my head, I can think of two massive risks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your library says a lot about you<sup id="fnref:bwitched"><a href="#fn:bwitched" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. If an advertising company was able to get a complete list of your music library (along with changes to it over time) then they could very easily target you with specific ads. Added a lot of Taylor Swift recently? Here are some ads relevant to that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When iOS first came out there was something called a UDID which basically identified your device uniquely. This was used by marketers to track you across multiple apps and build up a profile. This was stopped by Apple a few years back and replaced with an advertising identifier which you can turn off and which can only be used between apps from the same company (where they are probably already tracking you). However, with a full music library, it would be fairly easy to track someone across multiple apps as periodic snapshots could be compared on a server.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve no idea if apps are already doing this in the background silently but it is something that shouldn’t be able to happen. To that end, I’ve filed a bug report with Apple (<a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192">rdar://24168798</a>) to ask that they implement the same privacy controls that they do for contacts, calendars, photos, and location; a prompt when an app tries to access this data and the ability to grant or reject that permission through the system wide settings. Hopefully this is something Apple will implement in iOS 10 – if you’d like to see this happen, please duplicate bug 24168798 in the <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com">Apple Bug Reporter</a> as that is the best way to bring it to their attention.</p>

			<p>I’m very pleased to announce that another client app I developed recently has gone live in the App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Munchkin Report for iPhone</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-hero.jpg" width="800" height="532" /></p>

<p><a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">Munchkin Report</a> is an online service that helps you track your child’s moments, big and small. From her first steps to yesterday’s nap schedule, Munchkin Report captures memories, keeps parents and caregivers in-sync, and helps you make informed decisions.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure to work on this app as I was able to work in an incredibly efficient way. The client provided me with a complete API (including full documentation<sup id="fnref:apidocumentation"><a href="#fn:apidocumentation" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) and some static wireframes; I was then left to my own devices for a couple of weeks and given creative freedom to build my own design and tweak the UX as I saw fit. In the end I settled on an iOS 7 style minimal design which puts the important information up front and uses bold colours for UI controls.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-flow.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>The design is optimised for all four sizes of iPhone from the tiny iPhone 4s to the massive iPhone 6s Plus. It was written in Swift 2.1 and runs on iOS 9.0 and greater.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-3d-touch.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>I had just received my iPhone 6s when I started the project so as a little extra<sup id="fnref:extratouch"><a href="#fn:extratouch" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I added 3D touch quick actions so you can quickly get to the log actions from the home screen. There is also “Peek and Pop” integration throughout.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased with the way this app turned out and I think it’ll be a great resource for childcarers and parents. Munchkin Report is free but does require an account from <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">munchkinreport.com</a> (free trials are available). You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Munchkin Report from the App Store</a> or <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">learn more on their website</a>.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:extratouch">
      <p>One of the main reasons I do client work is so I can experiment with new APIs I wouldn’t necessarily use if I was just doing my own apps.

			<p>I’m very pleased to announce that my first tvOS app for a client has gone live in the Apple TV App Store; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Calm Radio</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio.jpg" width="800" height="574" /></p>

<p><a href="https://calmradio.com/">Calm Radio</a> is an ubiquitous online radio service with over 150 channels dedicated to specific genres of music and relaxation such as meditation, piano, jazz, latin, and so on. It is free to listen to (with no account) but you can remove ads from the stream and get access to special features with a paid account.</p>

<p>With the Apple TV, I wanted to make the app fit in like a first class citizen of the platform and so I did all of the design and UX work myself with a focus on real time blurs and gradients. As you navigate around the huge array of channels, the background will subtley shift to softer versions of the key colours used in the artwork.</p>

<p>When you select a channel, you are shown a now playing page that has the title, artist, album, and artwork of the currently playing music. The background is a soft version of the channel artwork but you can choose one of 12 high definition videos to play in the background instead. These videos are looped and blended with the background gradient in order to keep the experience consistent and relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-atmospheres.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>You can choose up to 3 atmospheres (such as wind, rain, waterfalls, crickets, etc) to mix with the currently playing channel and they appear underneath the artwork of the currently playing track. I designed an intuitive and simple UI for this so that listeners could change the volume of each individual atmosphere relative to the channel without using sliders<sup id="fnref:sliders"><a href="#fn:sliders" class="footnote">1</a></sup> or cluttering the interface.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-top-shelf.jpg" width="800" height="426" /></p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to use as many tvOS features as possible and so I built in support for the “Top Shelf” allowing you to see and play various channels direct from the TV home screen.</p>

<p>This has been a great project to work on and I’ve learned a huge amount about the Apple TV and the ‘Focus Engine’ that powers it<sup id="fnref:simulator"><a href="#fn:simulator" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. It’s been a lot of fun to do my own UX and design work and I think it’s turned out really well; the client was so pleased with it that I’ve been hired to rebuild their existing universal iPhone and iPad app to make it match this design!</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download Calm Radio from the Apple TV App Store</a><sup id="fnref:calmradioapp"><a href="#fn:calmradioapp" class="footnote">3</a></sup> or <a href="https://calmradio.com/">learn more on their website</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:sliders">

			<time datetime="2016-01-11" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2016/01/11/fixing-emoji-footnote-arrow-in-jekyll/">January 11, 2016</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my static blog generator for a few years now but noticed a minor annoyance a few days ago; whenever I use footnotes<sup id="fnref:footnotes"><a href="#fn:footnotes" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the return arrow (↩︎) is converted into an emoji (<a href="http://emojipedia.org/leftwards-arrow-with-hook/️">↩️</a>) on iOS and in some RSS readers. Obviously this isn’t desirable and so after a bit of digging I was able to find a fix.</p>

<p>Firstly, this isn’t an issue with Jekyll but with <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org">kramdown</a> which does the Markdown conversion. Thankfully, there is a config option in kramdown 1.8.0 and above<sup id="fnref:kramdown"><a href="#fn:kramdown" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that lets you specify the text you want to use for the footnote return link and you can set it as unicode to stop it being converted to emoji. Just add the following to your <code>_config.yml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>kramdown:
  	  footnote_backlink: "&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;"
</code></pre>

<p>Regenerate your site and you should find that the emoji arrow is now back to a ↩︎.</p>

    	<div>
			<p>I’ve been using Interface Builder in more projects over the past few months due to the benefits of AutoLayout. This has led to me shifting more standard UI code (i.e. colors, borders, shadows, etc) into Interface Builder via the User Defined Runtime Attributes<sup id="fnref:udra"><a href="#fn:udra" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, this doesn’t work for the CALayer properties <code>shadowColor</code> and <code>borderColor</code> as they expect a CGColor rather than a UIColor.</p>

<p>To fix this in a recent project, <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift">I created a very basic CALayer extension</a> (in Swift) that adds UIColor accessors so you can set them via the User Defined Runtime Attributes as so:</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift">get the extension on GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:udra">
      <p>You basically just set <code>layer.cornerRadius</code> as the key path and use an NSNumber within the User Defined Runtime attributes and then Interface Builder will handle the rest - no more filling your code with <code>button.layer.cornerRadius = 8</code>, etc. <a href="#fnref:udra" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<p>Over the years, I’ve received a lot of emails offering me the chance to work on an exciting new project for free in return for some equity. This is an excerpt from one I got yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are currently developing a [redacted] site with some developers who are dragging their heels and would like to to jump ship.  They are more web developers and not used to app coding.  They have been working for free in returning for an equity share in the company.<sup id="fnref:dismissed"><a href="#fn:dismissed" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>We have pitched to a few venture capitalist who like the idea but need to see a minimum viable product out in the market place.</p>

  <p>Is this something you would entertain… work for free now but get a percentage of the company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I write back to (nearly) every email I receive so I used my standard “<em>sorry, I don’t ever work on an equity basis <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">as per my website</a></em>” reply. However, it’s starting to irritate me just how many of these emails I get per day, the fact they don’t read the clear disclaimer on <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">my contact page</a>, and the mindset that they must have to think that someone is going to work for free for a potential kickback later. Hopefully this post will clear up why I, and most other iPhone developers, will not work for free on your project<sup id="fnref:series"><a href="#fn:series" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong>
We have mouths to feed the same as anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> 
There is a huge amount of paid work available to freelance developers and it pays incredibly well<sup id="fnref:paid"><a href="#fn:paid" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Some might say that developers are risk averse and so of course they’d choose paid work over the risky equity venture but that isn’t really true — being a freelancer is already incredibly risky with the fact you have to find work and hope that the client does pay on time and as agreed. That said though, choosing equity over money is one step too far on the risk ladder; the chance of it succeeding is very small and you’ll end up working on it for much longer than you anticipated.</p>

<p>For example, lets say you’re a developer charging around £500 a day for your services. To get a project to MVP status, you’re likely going to need to work for 1-2 months so you’re looking at around £10-20k of lost revenue. At this point, you need to make back at least that sizeable amount of money in order to break even. However, as the MVP continues, there will be bugs and new features to be added and you’ll be expected to add them for free; after all, you’ve been doing it for so long by now and if the project needs to switch developers then it’ll most likely die and you’ll end up with nothing. You will keep working for free until the project does eventually fail; you might get some small amount back but the real likelihood is that you’ll end up with nothing but a portfolio piece and the realisation that you should have filled the last 6 months with paid work.</p>

<p>This isn’t hypothetical; whilst I don’t ever work for equity, I’ve worked on a freelance basis on projects who did have other developers working for equity. They were hardly ever available after the project launched (as they needed to work on other projects to put food on the table) and when they were available they did a poor job as they were doing it in their spare time and they’d lost any passion they had for the business. The project folded after 9 months and they got around £1500 for their troubles.</p>

<p>Even if a project does succeed and you do own a portion of the company, it is still going to be a very long time until you see any monetary reward for that. A company only pays it’s shareholders when it is profitable and most startups aggressively use any money they make to grow further; it will likely be years until you get anything. Of course, they might sell to another company and you’ll get a big windfall payment<sup id="fnref:divide"><a href="#fn:divide" class="footnote">4</a></sup> but that is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I have with ‘CEOs’ saying “<em>work for free now but get a percentage of the company</em>” is the hypocrisy of it. They are putting all of the risk of the business on the developers shoulders and bearing very little of it themselves. Most of these people with nothing but an idea are working in a full-time job and continue to do so during the life of the project as they don’t need to do much during development; if it fails, they don’t really lose much whereas a developer loses everything.</p>

<p>My one piece of advice for other freelancers and for people looking to hire them is <strong>“if the project owner isn’t willing to use savings or a loan to pay for a developer, then they are showing that they think the project is too risky”.</strong> When I built WallaBee, I insisted that all contractors were paid at market rate<sup id="fnref:wallabeepaid"><a href="#fn:wallabeepaid" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and did so with loans and money from my own freelancing<sup id="fnref:lost"><a href="#fn:lost" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. If you are trying to get an app built and you don’t do the same, you will not succeed.</p>

<p>This is why I do not work for equity. It isn’t just the fact that I’ll lose money, it’s that I don’t want to work for a business that treats professionals in this way<sup id="fnref:hailo"><a href="#fn:hailo" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <li id="fn:dismissed">
      <p>By this point I’ve already dismissed the project out of hand even if they are paying; I don’t work on projects started by other developers and I don’t work for people who treat developers who work for free like crap. I can’t ever imagining being this dismissive of people who have given their time for free and are presumably leaving with nothing. <a href="#fnref:dismissed" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>This should really be considered part 1 of a series entitled <em>‘So you want an iOS developer?’</em>. Later articles in the series will be <em>‘Why iOS developers won’t sign an NDA’</em> and <em>‘Why you should pay your invoice when you receive it, not 60 days later’</em>. <a href="#fnref:series" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:paid">
      <p>I charge near the higher end as my portfolio and experience allows but even at the lower end you’re still talking £300-350 per day! <a href="#fnref:paid" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:divide">
      <p>As we discussed on this weeks episode of <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/16/the-divide-4-getting-into-code/"><em>The Divide</em></a> <a href="#fnref:divide" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:wallabeepaid">
      <p>One of my freelancers wanted to have equity and I said no. In my opinion, only founders should have equity tied up in a startup as then they are the ones that succeed or fail; contractors should always be paid. <a href="#fnref:wallabeepaid" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:lost">
      <p>I haven’t made back the money I invested in that business yet but I do have equity in the company that bought it; that is a scenario where equity can be appropriate. <a href="#fnref:lost" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:hailo">
      <p>I have form in this belief. Many, many years ago, I was offered the chance to work on a project by a guy who was happy boasting about the millions he made from a previous project. We agreed my freelance rate and when we’d start. He changed the start date and I found other work. He then wanted to move the start date back and was very annoyed when he found out I’d taken other work; he then went on to try and negotiate my day rate down. I walked away at that point as I don’t work for boastful millionaires who look to save £20 a day on an already low freelance rate. That company was <a href="https://www.hailoapp.com">Hailo</a> and became wildly successful. I don’t ever regret not working for them (though I probably should regret not asking them for equity). <a href="#fnref:hailo" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/">I sold WallaBee</a>, I’ve been splitting my time between client work<sup id="fnref:clients"><a href="#fn:clients" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, my Xbox One, and doing small apps that help improve my life in little ways. Today, Apple finally approved<sup id="fnref:appstore"><a href="#fn:appstore" class="footnote">2</a></sup> my first self-published app in a long time, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Pocket Rocket</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/pocket-rocket.jpg" width="800" height="500" /></p>

<p>I save most articles that I want to read at a later date with <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> but I hate their mobile apps. Tapping an article will load their own reader view<sup id="fnref:broken"><a href="#fn:broken" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and it’s an extra step to jump to Safari. In addition, their apps aren’t updated for split screen support or new device sizes and so the experience is pretty poor. With Pocket Rocket, I wanted to do one thing; have my Pocket queue load up and then when you tap on an article it should load in Safari. I prefer using Safari as then you get to see the article as intended and with content blockers most pages load quickly. I got the basic version working within in an hour and it worked well enough for my needs; then, when I got the iPad Pro, I realised this could be a useful app for other people as it dramatically improves the reading experience especially when used in split screen mode.</p>

<p>Pocket Rocket is completely free with no ads or tracking<sup id="fnref:noads"><a href="#fn:noads" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. It runs on any device capable of running iOS 9 and is a fully adaptive so it looks great no matter what screen-size you have. Due to this adaptability, it works in all split-screen modes on applicable iPads and that is the way I tend to use it. You can swipe on an article to archive or delete it upon reading. There is also a settings panel so you can choose whether links open in Safari or via an in-app browser (with the option to enable a reader view<sup id="fnref:reader"><a href="#fn:reader" class="footnote">5</a></sup> on launch if you want).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;mt=8">get Pocket Rocket for free on the App Store</a>.</p>

      <p>Of which I’ve done a lot; recently launched apps include <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/">Brapp</a>, <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/11/19/chippd-app-for-sharing-personal-messages/">Chipp’d</a>, and <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/17/natural-cycles-apple-watch-app/">Natural Cycles</a> with two more apps awaiting approval from Apple… <a href="#fnref:clients" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>I won’t go into details as Apple specifically request people don’t, but it has been one of the longest and most painful App Store review processes to date. I don’t know if they’ve been having a bad month but a number of my projects have had a rough ride through the review process for no good reason lately. <a href="#fnref:appstore" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>I hate their reader view as it often misses text or puts pull quotes in the wrong places. In addition, the scrolling was completely broken on the iPhone 6S for a few weeks. <a href="#fnref:broken" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:noads">
      <p>Literally nothing leaves your device apart from when you log in with Pocket (and that is a secure connection with Pocket’s servers via OAuth so I see nothing); I don’t want to know anything about you and respect your privacy. This also isn’t a money-making exercise so the whole thing is free with no In-App Purchases. <a href="#fnref:noads" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

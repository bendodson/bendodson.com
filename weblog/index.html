			<p>As we get to the final month before WWDC 2023, I‚Äôm reminded of all the new APIs that were released at WWDC 2022 that I haven‚Äôt made use of yet. One of those new APIs was the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicediscoveryui">DeviceDiscoveryUI framework</a> which allows an Apple TV app to connect and communicate with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch.</p>

<p>A good example of this would be how the Apple Watch communicates with the Apple Fitness app:</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/Apple-Fitness-Plus-HIIT-workout-lifestyle-220907.jpg" width="800" height="450" />
    <figure><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2022/09/apple-fitness-plus-available-to-all-iphone-users-in-21-countries-later-this-fall/">Image &copy; 2022 Apple</a></figure>
</div>

<p>It‚Äôs not necessarily a fair comparison as whilst you might expect them to be the same, the DeviceDiscoveryUI framework has a number of restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It only works on tvOS (so you can‚Äôt communicate between an Apple Watch and an iPad like Apple Fitness can)</li>
  <li>It only works on Apple TV 4K (Apple Fitness can work with Apple TV HD)</li>
  <li>The tvOS app can only connect to one device at a time (i.e. you couldn‚Äôt make a game with this that used two iPhones as controllers)</li>
  <li>The tvOS app can only connect to other versions of your app that share the same bundle identifier (and are thus sold with Universal Purchase)</li>
  <li>This will not work on either the tvOS or iOS simulators. You must use physical devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The UI for the connection setup is also different to Apple Fitness as we will see shortly.</p>

<p>My use case for this technology is a bit convoluted as I was really looking for an excuse to use it rather than the best fit. I have a personal app named <em><a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2021/03/10/stoutness/">Stoutness</a></em> that I use on my Apple TV every morning to give me a briefing on my day whilst I do my chiropractic stretches. Using shortcuts and various apps on my iPhone, I send a ton of data to my server which the Apple TV app then fetches and uses. The app also communicates directly with some 3rd party APIs such as YouTube and Pocket.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for the app is to get me to work through my backlogs of games, books, videos, and articles by having the app randomly pick from my various lists and presenting them to me; I then know ‚Äúout of the 4 books I‚Äôm currently reading, I should read <em>x</em> today‚Äù. The problem is that later in the day I often forget what the app had decided I should use, a particular problem when it suggests 5 articles for me to read from a backlog of about 200 üò¨. Whilst I cache this information daily in the Apple TV app, it‚Äôs a bit of a pain to fire it up just to skip through a few screens and remember what I should be reading. Surely this information would be better on my phone?</p>

<p>The obvious way to do this would be for the server to make the calls to Pocket and YouTube and then store the daily cache in my database along with the random choices of games and books. An iOS app could then download that in the same way the tvOS app does. This is true, but it‚Äôs not as fun as learning a new framework and having my phone connect to the Apple TV to a) send all the data that my shortcuts used to do directly and b) have the cache be sent back in response ready to be used on iOS.</p>

<p>After a brief look at the docs, I naively assumed this would be done in an hour as it looked vaguely similar to the way in which an iPhone app can talk to an embedded Apple Watch app or a Safari extension via two way messaging. After 4 hours, I finally got something working but it does not feel as solid as I would like‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Apple provide a developer article titled ‚Äú<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicediscoveryui/connecting_a_tvos_app_to_other_devices_over_the_local_network?changes=late__6__8">Connecting a tvOS app to other devices over the local network</a>‚Äù that sounds like it should be exactly what we need. It details how we present the connection UI (in both SwiftUI and UIKit), how to listen for the connection on iOS / iPadOS / watchOS, and how to initiate the connection. However, there are two issues with this article.</p>

<p>First of all, most of the code in it doesn‚Äôt actually compile or is being used incorrectly. The SwiftUI code references a ‚Äúdevice name‚Äù variable which isn‚Äôt present<sup id="fnref:devicename" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:devicename" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, fails to include the required ‚Äúfallback‚Äù view block (for displaying on unsupported devices like the Apple TV HD), and presents the device picker behind a connect button failing to notice that the picker itself has it‚Äôs own connect button which sits transparently above the one you just pressed.</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/DevicePicker-SwiftUI-Overlay.gif" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>For the UIKit code, it references an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NWEndpointPickerViewController</code> which doesn‚Äôt exist. The correct name is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicediscoveryui/dddevicepickerviewcontroller"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DDDevicePickerViewController</code></a>.</p>

<p>Once the actual picker is presented, things start to look very promising. You get a fullscreen view that shows your app icon with a privacy string that you define within Info.plist on the left hand side whilst any applicable devices are listed on the right hand side:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/DeviceDiscoveryUI-tvOS.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>

<p>An important thing to note here is that the devices do not necessarily have your app installed, they are merely devices <em>potentially capable</em> of running your app.</p>

<p>When we initiate a connection to an iPhone, a notification is displayed. The wording can‚Äôt be controlled and will be different depending on whether the corresponding app is installed or not:</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/DevicePicker-Notifications-iOS.jpg" width="800" height="200" />
    <figure>Connection notification request for iOS from tvOS both with and without the app installed. If the app is installed, the notification uses the Apple TV name for the title (‚ÄúOffice‚Äù in this case).</figure>
</div>

<p>You seem to have around 30 seconds to accept the connection otherwise the tvOS interface goes back a step and you need to send a new request. If you do not have the app installed, tapping the notification will take you to the App Store page.</p>

<p>We now come to the second problem in Apple‚Äôs documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as the user selects a device, the system passes you an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NWEndpoint</code>. Use this endpoint to connect to the selected device. Create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NWConnection</code>, passing it both the endpoint and the parameters that you used to create the device picker view. <strong>You can then use this connection to send or receive messages to the connected device.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emphasis above is mine. This is the extent of the documentation on how to actually use the connection to send and receive messages. It turns out that the connection uses classes from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/hotspot_helper/in-provider_networking?changes=late__6__8">In-Provider Networking</a> that was introduced in iOS 9 specifically for network extensions. In fact, this is still the case according to the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These APIs have the following key characteristics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>They aren‚Äôt general-purpose APIs; they can only be used in the context of a NetworkExtension provider or hotspot helper.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There is zero documentation on how to use these APIs in the context of Apple TV to iOS / iPadOS / WatchOS communication ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ.</p>

<p>In terms of sending messages, there is only one method aptly named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">send(content:contentContext:isComplete:completion:)</code>. This allows us to send any arbitrary Data such as a JSON-encoded string.</p>

<p>The real problem is how to receive those messages. There is a method named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">receiveMessage(completion:)</code> which, based on my work with watchOS and iOS extensions, sounds promising. Apple describes it as ‚Äú<em>schedules a single receive completion handler for a complete message, as opposed to a range of bytes</em>‚Äù. Perfect!</p>

<p>Except it isn‚Äôt called, at least not when a message is sent. In a somewhat frustrating act, the messages only appear once the connection is terminated either because the tvOS app stops or because I cancel the connection. I tried for multiple hours but could not get that endpoint to fire unless the entire connection was dropped (at which point any messages that were sent during that time would come through as one single piece of data). I can only assume the messages are being cached locally without being delivered yet when the connection drops it suddenly decides to unload them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ.</p>

<p>It turns out you need to use the more complex <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">receive(minimumIncompleteLength:maximumLength:completion:)</code> which requires you to say how big you want batches of data to be. You also need to resubscribe to this handler every time data appears on it. The problem here is that whilst there is a ‚Äúcompletion‚Äù flag to tell you if the whole message has arrived this is never true when sending from tvOS, even if you use the corresponding flag on the send method. In the end, I limited the app to 1MB of data at a time as everything I send is well below that. I‚Äôve never run into a problem with only partial data being sent but it is a potential risk to be aware of.</p>

<p>If you were using this for critical data, I‚Äôd probably suggest only sending encoded text and providing your own delimiter to look for i.e. for each string that comes in batch them together until one ends in a ‚Äú|||‚Äù at which point you will know that was the end of a message from tvOS.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the connection setup and data sending are near instantaneous and the user facing UI works well. However, as there were already low-level network solutions to send data between devices (including non-Apple devices) it‚Äôs incredibly odd to me that Apple went to the effort of creating a beautiful device pairing API and UI for both SwiftUI and UIKit but didn‚Äôt extend that to the basics of sending data. Local networking is hard. I have no interest in diving into the minutia of handling UDP packets; I just want to send some basic strings between devices!</p>

<p>In order to get this all working for my own app, I created a class named <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/LocalDeviceManager/blob/main/LocalDeviceManager.swift"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LocalDeviceManager</code></a> that handles this all for you along with a <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/LocalDeviceManager/">SwiftUI demo project</a> for both tvOS and iOS that demonstrates how it works. The call site on tvOS is very simple:</p>

<p>There are more details on how this works on <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/LocalDeviceManager/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Judging by the complete lack of 3rd party apps using this feature or articles detailing how to use this API I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll see any improvements to this system in tvOS 17. Regardless, I‚Äôve filed a few bug reports in the hopes that the documentation can be tidied up a bit. Just be aware that this is not the robust solution I was hoping it would be!</p>

			<time datetime="2023-03-14" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2023/03/14/postmortem-of-a-top-10-paid-ios-app/">March 14, 2023</a></time>

    	<div>
			<p>It‚Äôs been 4 weeks since the v2.0 update for <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-library-tracker/">Music Library Tracker</a> launched so I thought now was a good time for a retrospective to detail how I promoted the app and how well it performed.</p>

<p>By way of a bit of background, the app originally launched back in January 2016 at a $0.99 price point making $1368 in it‚Äôs first month before dropping off significantly to roughly $20 a month. In January 2021, I was accepted into the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App Store Small Business Program</a> which meant the amount Apple took from sales fell from 30% to 15%; I had also increased the price and released a few more updates so the average profit for the half year prior to the v2.0 update in February was sitting at around $80 a month<sup id="fnref:historic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:historic" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is by no means an income (especially as I have to pay corporation tax on it in the UK and then if I want to actually take the money for myself rather than my business I‚Äôll have to pay some more tax) but it was fine for an app that didn‚Äôt have any running costs nor require much maintenance.</p>

<p>And then v2.0 happened.</p>

<p>With a new feature set built around Spatial Audio, v2.0 was released on 13th February 2023 after a 9 month development period, 3 months of which was open development via <a href="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/">my newsletter</a>. It was reported on by a couple of tech sites (I‚Äôll detail how shortly) and ended up being the #8 Paid app in the US!</p>

<p>So how much money does an app need to make to be in the Top 10 of all paid apps on the App Store?</p>

<div class="gofigure">

    <figure>Daily profit in USD over the past 28 days peaking at $1534 on February 15th</figure>
</div>

<p>Not as much as you might think! You can <a href="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/music-library-tracker-v2-sales.csv">download a full breakdown</a> but the key figures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profit of $82 on 13th Feb (launch day), $1449 on 14th Feb, $1534 on 15th Feb, and $414 on 16th Feb</li>
  <li>Total profit of $5351 over 28 days</li>
  <li>An average daily profit of $191</li>
  <li>Only a single sale on March 6th üò≠</li>
</ul>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.dailysalesemail.com">Daily Sales Email</a> to find out how much I‚Äôve made each day but the figures typically arrive around lunchtime on the following day. That meant I could see the app in the Top 10 of all paid apps but had no idea what that would translate into<sup id="fnref:analytics" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:analytics" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I‚Äôll confess that whilst I was pleased with the numbers, I was a little disappointed that I‚Äôd made less than what I charge for 2 days as a freelance iOS developer.</p>

<p>That said, the app has settled down into making roughly $40 per day which works out at around $1200 per month, not bad for something that will hopefully only need minor maintenance.</p>

<p>With the financial breakdown out of the way, I thought it might be interesting to detail exactly how I promoted the app. I will be completely honest and say it is not my strong suit at all. I hate doing app promotion work; it is abhorrent to me. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the Englishman in me or something else but I absolutely hate having to email people saying ‚Äúplease look at my app‚Äù followed by the waiting and hoping that somebody will feature it. However, that‚Äôs what I had to do as an app of this nature likely isn‚Äôt going to generate enough revenue to make hiring a marketing person cost effective.</p>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>

<p>The key thing for an app like this is for it to be written about by a tech site. I‚Äôve had a couple articles in the past from sites like <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/15/music-tracker-large-libraries/">9to5mac</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/20/music-tracker-apple-music-library-monitoring/">MacRumors</a> so my first port of call was to send them an email. As previously mentioned, I hate doing this stuff but I felt on slightly firmer ground with these sites as they‚Äôd written about the app before so that seemed like a good ‚Äúin‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back in 2016 you were kind enough to review an app of mine, Music Library Tracker (https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/15/music-tracker-large-libraries/).</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm getting in touch as I‚Äôve just released a large v2.0 update to the app which includes some features around Spatial Audio. In short, the app can quickly scan your library and show you exactly which songs have been upgraded to Spatial Audio and generate a playlist containing just those tracks; it will then run in the background periodically and notify you as and when tracks are upgraded and keep that playlist up to date.</p>

  <p>This is all possible due to a database of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Audio tracks I‚Äôve created over the past 9 months to run my Spatial Audio Finder website (https://bendodson.com/projects/spatial-audio-finder/) and the @NewSpatialAudio Twitter account (https://twitter.com/NewSpatialAudio) which tweets whenever a new track is upgraded. This database is sourced from a minor update to the Apple Music API at WWDC 22 - you can see how this all works in a blog post I wrote last year (https://bendodson.com/weblog/2022/06/27/spatial-audio-finder/) but suffice to say I do not believe there is anyone outside of Apple with a dataset such as this.</p>

  <p>Apple Music does not yet have a clear strategy for displaying Spatial Audio tracks. Whilst they have some playlists and collections that get updated weekly, the only way to tell which tracks in your own library are upgraded is to play them and see. This is obviously not ideal and not a great way to showcase what is a genuine leap in musical quality and the hundreds of thousands of tracks that have been upgraded. I created this feature as I was determined to find a way to see which tracks had been updated. From the response I‚Äôve received via @NewSpatialAudio it seems I‚Äôm not alone!</p>

  <p>The app is still a single cost download (25% off for the next week) with no in-app purchases, subscriptions, or adverts so anybody who downloaded the app in the past 7 years will get this new feature for free. I‚Äôve provided a few promo codes below in case you or anyone at the MacRumors team are interested in taking a look:</p>

  <p>CODE1<br />
CODE2<br />
CODE3</p>

  <p>You can see some more information about the app at https://dodoapps.io/music-library-tracker/ and there is a full media kit with screenshots, etc, at https://dodoapps.io/music-library-tracker/media-kit/</p>

  <p>The update is available now on the App Store at https://apple.co/3XtdAga</p>

  <p>If you have any questions at all about the app, my Spatial Audio database, or anything else relating to Spatial Audio then just let me know.</p>

  <p>All the best,</p>

  <p>Ben</p>

<p>I sent this email on the 13th February to the reviews@9to5mac.com address (as my previous contact had since moved elsewhere) and a very similar version with a different link directly to the Senior Editor at MacRumors who wrote a previous article. I got a <a href="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/9to5mac-bounceback.png">very strange bounceback email</a> from 9to5mac and I didn‚Äôt get a reply at all from MacRumors. As the bounceback was so odd, I waited a day and then sent a follow up email to tips@9to5mac.com; it was a good thing I did as Chance Miller got in touch within 30 minutes and shortly afterwards there was an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/14/apple-music-spatial-audio-songs/">article published</a>. This is undoubtedly what led to the spike in sales on the 14th and afterwards.</p>

<p>In addition to those two outlets, I sent similar emails to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TechRadar (via news@techradar.com): their Entertainment Editor replied after a couple of hours and we had a few emails back and forth discussing various aspects of Spatial Audio such as how Apple bans AI upscaling. They <a href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/finding-dolby-atmos-tracks-on-apple-music-is-hell-this-app-fixes-that">published an article</a> the next day but it didn‚Äôt show up in their RSS feed and is not visible on their website unless you follow the direct link (which was tweeted but had practically zero engagement)</li>
  <li>AppleInsider (direct to one of their writers who had written a recent article about Spatial Audio): I didn‚Äôt get a reply and there hasn‚Äôt been an article</li>
  <li>MacStories (direct email to John and Federico): I didn‚Äôt get a reply but it was listed in the ‚ÄúApp Debuts‚Äù section of the Club MacStories newsletter for paid subscribers</li>
</ul>

<p>The following week I sent an email to iMore as I‚Äôd noticed an <a href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/apple-music/apple-is-showcasing-non-spatial-audio-albums-in-the-spatial-audio-page">interesting article</a> relating to Spatial Audio. I couldn‚Äôt find an email address for the author, Tammy Rogers, so instead sent an email direct to the Features Editor, Daryl Baxter, who was listed as a contributor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Daryl,</p>

  <p>I came across a recent article you contributed to, ‚ÄúApple Music is showcasing non-Spatial Audio albums in it‚Äôs Spatial Audio page‚Äù, and had two things that may be of interest to you and Tammy (I couldn‚Äôt find an email address for her so my apologies for not including her as well).</p>

  <p>First of all, the reason that those albums are being listed within Apple Music‚Äôs Spatial Audio playlists is because they have some tracks on them that are available in Spatial Audio. The referenced No Pressure by Logic has two tracks that have been upgraded (GP4 and Perfect) whilst McCartney (2011) remaster has the first 13 tracks available in Spatial Audio. I know this because I created something called the Spatial Audio Finder which lets you find which tracks have been updated for a particular artist (I‚Äôve got a blog post at https://bendodson.com/weblog/2022/06/27/spatial-audio-finder/ which explains how that all works). I also publish when tracks are upgraded to the @NewSpatialAudio Twitter feed.</p>

  <p>You also mentioned in the article that it‚Äôs quite hard to find Spatial Audio tracks within Apple Music. This is a huge bugbear of mine and so I recently updated an app of mine, Music Library Tracker, with some new features around Spatial Audio. The app was originally designed to help notify you when Apple changes your music (i.e. if a song is deleted due to licensing changes, etc) but it can now scan your library and show you which tracks you have that are available in Spatial Audio along with creating a playlist in Apple Music containing only those tracks. It can then keep monitoring your library and send you notifications as and when new tracks are updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The rest of the email is similar to the initial one above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I received a reply a few days later and then after 2 weeks <a href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/apple-music/this-app-makes-finding-your-apple-music-spatial-audio-tracks-easier-than-ever">an article appeared</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the sites I reached out to, a few sites published articles organically including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://appadvice.com/post/music-library-tracker-is-perfect-for-fans-of-spatial-audio-tracks-on-apple-music/776748">AppAdvice</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.whathifi.com/news/you-can-now-find-out-when-apple-music-songs-get-spatial-audio-fied">What Hi-Fi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-to-discover-spatial-audio-tracks-in-your-apple-music-library">Tom‚Äôs Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôd like to give a big thank you to all of the people who did get back to me or wrote about the app - I‚Äôm very grateful! However, the experience of doing this is easily the worst part of being an independent app developer. I absolutely hate having to hawk the app around and then have the long period of waiting and hoping for an article to appear. I always try and craft my emails to be very specific to something the site has covered before or to provide some kind of story so it‚Äôs a bit easier to form a narrative other than ‚Äúplease talk about my app‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredibly disappointing when you don‚Äôt even get an email back. As I hated doing it, I‚Äôd typically send an email and then think ‚Äúthat‚Äôll do‚Äù and by the time I realised a site wasn‚Äôt going to pick it up then the launch window had passed and it felt even more awkward to email in (especially as it had already been covered by 9to5mac so other sites could have potentially already seen that article and not wanted to cover something which is now old news).</p>

<p>A few things I should have done differently:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I should have contacted people before the launch of the app rather than afterward. I don‚Äôt like contacting anyone before Apple have approved an app as that can lead to all sorts of problems. I‚Äôd already public committed to a date and didn‚Äôt give myself much room between approval and release so just sent the messages out post-launch. In an ideal world, I should have had a week or even two with the app approved within which I could have sent out promo codes or TestFlight invites so the app could be reviewed and embargoed. That would lead to a much bigger ‚Äúsplash‚Äù and also avoids the issue of sites potentially not wanting to promote an app that has already been promoted elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have written to more sites rather than just the ones I typically read. I did do some research to find sites that had talked about Spatial Audio (as I wanted some kind of an ‚Äúin‚Äù when writing to someone who‚Äôd never heard of me before) but I probably should have just gone with a scattergun approach to anybody that is even vaguely app adjacent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had no idea if the promo codes I was sending out were being used so couldn‚Äôt really tell if my emails were getting through. Once you‚Äôve generated a promo code within App Store Connect, the only way to see if it has been redeemed or not is to try and redeem it (which is obviously not a good idea). I could easily just provide a link to my site which, when accessed, gives out a promo code and can then tell me that has happened but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me and I‚Äôd be afraid it would be something that would put people off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have followed up with the sites that didn‚Äôt reply to me. I did that with 9to5mac which definitely paid off but I felt more comfortable doing that as it seemed clear there was a technical error; sending a ‚Äúsorry but did you get my email?‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt really be anxiety inducing but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are a writer for a tech site with any insight or a developer that has had any success stories with this then I‚Äôd absolutely love to hear from you!</p>

<h2 id="getting-featured-on-the-app-store-form">Getting Featured on the App Store Form</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre looking at ways to promote an app, getting featured by Apple on the App Store is obviously a high priority goal. There have been <a href="https://nemecek.be/blog/169/how-to-get-featured-on-the-app-store">several articles recently</a> about using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/">dedicated form</a> on the Apple Developer website with the key takeaway being to submit the form for every app update.</p>

<p>I have never used this form before, mostly because my apps tend to either be very niche or are something like this app which I‚Äôm always somewhat surprised makes it through App Review in one piece üòÜ. However I did it use it and something unexpected happened‚Ä¶ I got an email from the Apple Services Performance Partnership Team<sup id="fnref:appleservicesteam" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:appleservicesteam" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are currently recruiting new partners to promote the latest of Apple‚Äôs products to join the programme: Apple MusicKit.</p>

  <p>MusicKit lets users play Apple Music and their local music library from your app or website. So, when your users provide permission to access their Apple Music account, they can use your app or website to create playlists, add songs to their library, and play any of the millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog! If your app detects that the user is not yet an Apple Music member, you can offer a trial membership from within your app. The Apple Music Affiliate Program allows you to earn a commission on eligible referred Music memberships (new sign-ups only)! You can find more detailed information here as well as in the document attached.</p>

  <p>We have noticed that you already use the Apple Music API and we believe adding in MusicKit would be an easy process for you and a great benefit! We offer generous compensation models and would like to talk you through this opportunity in more detail.</p>

  <p>Please let us know your avails, so we can go ahead and schedule a call with you. üòä</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did take the call<sup id="fnref:teams" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:teams" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and it is effectively outreach to try and get developers to promote Apple Music within their apps in exchange for a commission on any new subscriptions. You can already <a href="https://partners.applemediaservices.com/other-partners">apply for this directly</a> but I guess Apple saw that I was using MusicKit on the form I filled out and so set this up. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not really a good fit for this app (you‚Äôre likely not using it if you don‚Äôt have Apple Music) but it may be useful for another app I have in the pipeline in which I‚Äôd already added the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skcloudservicesetupviewcontroller/offering_apple_music_subscription_in_your_app">‚ÄúSubscribe to Apple Music‚Äù interstitial</a> that this hooks into.</p>

<p>Going back to the form, the app has not been featured anywhere on the App Store but I had very little expectation of that happening.</p>

<h2 id="app-store-ads">App Store Ads</h2>

<p>I took a look at promoting the app using Apple Search Ads and found that it was recommending a suggested ‚ÄúCost-per-Install‚Äù of ¬£5.61. This is not ideal bearing in mind the app cost ¬£2.49 at the time ü§£</p>

<p>After I posted that on Twitter the developer of the excellent <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvis-pro/id1447768809">Marvis Pro</a> music app, Aditya Rajveer, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdityaRajveer/status/1625523289321005057">reached out</a> and said ‚ÄúIt almost never reached the suggested amount per install for my app, not even close‚Äù. That pushed me to give it a try and they were right! I‚Äôve had it running for a few weeks now and have had 22 installs on an average Cost-Per-Install of ¬£0.89. That‚Äôs not exactly setting my sales alight but it‚Äôs better than nothing. On a more positive note, I‚Äôm not actually being charged for these installs as I have a promotional balance apparently. I seem to remember I claimed a free $100 of advertising years and years ago so evidently that is still in use ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ</p>

<h2 id="app-store-in-app-events">App Store In-App Events</h2>

<p>I created an In-App Event on the App Store to coincide with the release of the update which ran for 1 week:</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2023/music-library-tracker-in-app-event.jpg" width="645" height="548" />
    <figure>The irony is that you can't listen to Spatial Audio on those headphones but it was the only decent royalty-free image I could find...</figure>
</div>

<p>This had 4700 impressions leading to 9 downloads and 24 app opens. Again, not terribly exciting but extra sales are extra sales.</p>

<h2 id="other-promotions">Other Promotions</h2>

<p>I obviously promoted the app on my own <a href="https://mastodon.bendodson.com/@ben">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bendodson/">Twitter accounts</a> but I also tweeted about it on the <a href="https://twitter.com/newspatialaudio">@NewSpatialAudio</a> account which I believe led to the article on Tom‚Äôs Guide. There‚Äôs also <a href="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/">my newsletter</a> and <a href="https://bendodson.com/">my website</a> which mentioned the app. Finally, it was mentioned in both the <a href="https://indiedevmonday.com/issue-134">Indie Dev Monday</a> and <a href="https://swiftlyrush.curated.co/issues/62">SwiftlyRush</a> newsletters.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-actually-worked">So what actually worked?</h2>

<p>App Store Connect provides a metrics panel which roughly details where your downloads have come from. Rather astonishingly, it turns out that 43.4% of all my downloads in the past month came from ‚ÄúApp Store Browse‚Äù. This is followed by ‚ÄúWeb Referer‚Äù at 28.3%, ‚ÄúApp Store Search‚Äù at 13.4%, and ‚ÄúApp Referer‚Äù at 12.8%.</p>

<p>If I dig into that a little more I can see that most of the app referer traffic was either Facebook, Google, or Google Chrome (so likely clicking on links from one of the published articles). With web referer, the vast majority is 9to5mac.com followed by my own <a href="https://dodoapps.io/music-library-tracker/">Dodo Apps website</a>. Everything else is single digits.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the 9to5mac article created enough downloads to catapult the app up the Paid App charts and it was there that it was discovered by those just browsing the App Store who then made up the majority of my sales. This seems incredibly backwards to me as I‚Äôd assume the technical readership for whom this app is more likely aimed at would be the majority of downloaders but I suspect that with the billions of iOS devices in the world even a fractional percentage of users browsing the App Store is going to be magnitudes larger than the number of followers that the tech sites have.</p>

<p>In terms of next steps, I‚Äôm at a slight loss as to what to do as I don‚Äôt have any big splashy features that would merit the coverage that is clearly key to increasing the number of downloads. Having looked at what other developers are doing, it looks like I should try finding an influencer on TikTok but I know absolutely nothing about that world. I could also look at direct advertising on some of the tech sites or podcasts that would be relevant but doing so is likely going to be thousands of pounds worth of investment and feels like a bit of a gamble given this is a low-cost paid app rather than a subscription based service that can recoup large advertising costs over months of later usage.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve got any thoughts or insights then I‚Äôd <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">love to hear from you</a>. I‚Äôd also love it if you <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">downloaded the app</a> üòâ</p>

			<p><span class="prelude">This is part of a <a href="/sideprojects/">series of blog posts</a> in which I showcase some of the side projects I work on for my own use. As with all of my side projects, I‚Äôm not focused on perfect code or UI; <a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/butitdoesrun.jpg">it just needs to run</a>!</span></p>

<p>If I‚Äôm going on a long drive with my two young children, I‚Äôll load up an iPad with some videos and stick it in a pouch on the back of a seat to keep them entertained. Initially this started as a few films and a couple of their TV series on a USB-C stick but I‚Äôve gradually started putting a few shows directly onto the iPad so they can be played via VLC. Why? Well, when using an external drive you‚Äôre limited to using the Files app which uses Quick View for video playback; this is fine for a film but for TV you have to go and start a new episode after the previous one finishes (and that involves my wife precariously leaning into the back without a seatbelt which isn‚Äôt ideal). I moved to using VLC for TV shows as they then play sequentially avoiding that problem but it can‚Äôt play from an external drive so I have to put things directly onto the limited storage of the device.</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of whether I could build a better app, one that would let me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plug in an external drive</li>
  <li>Show each series with a nice image</li>
  <li>Play episodes randomly without needing to copy the video to the device</li>
</ul>

<p>After a 3 hour drive to visit my mother, the priority for this has now increased exponentially üòÇ</p>

<p>To begin with, I needed to know if it is even possible to view external files within an app on iOS. It is, and has been since the introduction of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIDocumentPickerViewController</code> in iOS 13 however the documentation left me a little confused:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both the open and export operations grant access to documents outside your app‚Äôs sandbox. This access gives users an unprecedented amount of flexibility when working with their documents. However, it also adds a layer of complexity to your file handling. External documents have the following additional requirements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The open and move operations provide security-scoped URLs for all external documents. Call the startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() method to access or bookmark these documents, and the stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource() method to release them. If you‚Äôre using a UIDocumentsubclass to manage your document, it automatically manages the security-scoped URL for you.</li>
    <li>Always use file coordinators (see NSFileCoordinator) to read and write to external documents.</li>
    <li>Always use a file presenter (see NSFilePresenter) when displaying the contents of an external document.</li>
    <li>Don‚Äôt save URLs that the open and move operations provide. You can, however, save a bookmark to these URLs after calling startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() to ensure you have access. Call the bookmarkData(options:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeTo:) method and pass in the withSecurityScope option, creating a bookmark that contains a security-scoped URL.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>External files can only be accessed via a security-scoped URL and all of the tutorials I‚Äôd seen online relating to this were demonstrating how you could access a file and then copy it locally before removing that scope. I was therefore unsure how it would work in terms of streaming video (as it would go out of scope and lose security clearance) nor if I‚Äôd be able to retain access after displaying a directory and then wanting to start playback.</p>

<p>It turns out that it is all possible using a system known as ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù. In practice, a user will be shown their external drive in an OS controlled modal view and can select a folder, the URL of which is returned to my app. I then call the ‚Äústart accessing security scoped resource‚Äù and convert that URL to a bookmark which is stored locally on my device and then close the security scoped resource. That bookmark can be used at any point to gain access to the drive (so long as it hasn‚Äôt been disconnected in which case the bookmark tells the app it is ‚Äústale‚Äù and therefore no longer working) and you can then interact with the URL the bookmark provides in the same way as you would with a local file.</p>

<p>This would also work in other contexts such as local files or even cloud-based services that work with the Files app such as iCloud or Dropbox.</p>

<p>I had originally planned on reading the contents of the USB stick and using a single .jpg file in each directory to render a nice thumbnail. In the end I abandoned that as it would have meant building the whole interface when in fact it works perfectly well just using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIDocumentPickerViewController</code> to pick the show I‚Äôm interested in:</p>

<div class="gofigure">

    <figure>Selecting a directory of videos in Back Seat Shuffle</figure>
</div>

<p>In the end the only extra code I added was to strip out any files that were not in the .mp4 or .mkv format and to have it automatically return to the file selection screen once the full queue of randomised videos had finished.</p>

<p>Whilst I could potentially put it on the App Store, this is one of those weird edge cases that likely wouldn‚Äôt get through App Review as they‚Äôll look at it and say ‚Äúthis is just the Files app‚Äù and completely miss the point. As this would be a free app, it‚Äôs not worth the hassle of doing screenshots, App Store description, etc, only to have it be rejected by App Review.</p>

<p>The full app code is available on <a href="https://github.com/bendodson/back-seat-shuffle">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://restorationgames.com/return-to-dark-tower/">Return to Dark Tower</a> is a really cool app-driven board game that comes with a physical tower that you connect via Bluetooth to an iPad. The tower lights up, makes sounds, and spins internally to shoot little skulls you place into it over the outlying map.</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/return-to-dark-tower.jpg" width="800" height="600" />
    <figure>You put little skulls in the top of the tower to end your turn...</figure>
</div>

<p>As much as I love it, there are a ton of cards in the game so you can easily forget what abilities you have available to you or miss crucial triggers at key phases in the game. You can also take most actions in any order so it‚Äôs easy to forget what you‚Äôve done in the current turn, especially if you‚Äôre playing solo. To that end, I built myself a very niche app to keep track of all of the cards I had and all of the moves I‚Äôd made. It‚Äôs called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/return-to-dark-tower-assistant/id1659406816">Return to Dark Tower Assistant</a> and is optimised for use in an iPad Slide Over panel so you can use it on top of the app you use to run the game:</p>

    <figure>Running the assistant in a Slide Over panel so you can still access the board game app beneath!</figure>
</div>

<p>There‚Äôs a very slim chance that any of you reading this have a copy of this board game and even if you do it‚Äôs likely a small minority that would find utility in this app. That said, I think it demonstrates what I‚Äôve said for over a decade about making apps for yourself; build things for yourself on the off-chance that somebody else finds it as useful as you do. I spent far too much time matching the colours to the player boards, getting the fonts just right, and doing things like perfectly embedding the right icons for warrior and spirit tokens but I did that because I want it to look good when <em>I‚Äôm</em> playing. It will likely only get single-digit downloads, but it‚Äôs an app I‚Äôm proud of.</p>

<p>The assistant is available now on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/return-to-dark-tower-assistant/id1659406816">App Store</a>. You can also read more about it on my <a href="https://dodoapps.io/return-to-dark-tower-assistant/">Dodo Apps website</a>.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck">Elgato Stream Deck</a> is a fun device with 15 LED buttons that can be programmed to do whatever you want through an app that runs on PC and Mac. It was designed for streamers to be able to quickly switch scenes or present overlays but it has quickly become popular in other areas thanks to its flexible design. I picked one up in 2018 when I was dabbling with streaming but then mostly used it as control box for my Cessna 152 in Flight Simulator 2020 thanks to <a href="https://flightdeck.to/product/flightdeck/">FlightDeck</a>. I eventually replaced this with a bigger flight sim setup<sup id="fnref:flightsim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:flightsim" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> so the Stream Deck was sitting idle until I had the idea to integrate it into my app development workflow.</p>

    <figure>The Stream Deck running alongside my Mac Studio.</figure>
</div>

<p>I typically work on multiple projects per day as I have a number of active client projects at any one time along with my own independent apps. This means I often waste time getting set up for each project so my initial idea was to have a single button press to get my workspace configured.</p>

    <figure>A single button per platform to start a project.</figure>
</div>

<p>For example, I may want to start a specific Toggl timer, open a Jira board, and open the Xcode project. To do this, I created a single AppleScript file that is opened by the Stream Deck that will look something like this:</p>

<p>In the first block I activate the Timery app and tell it to perform the keyboard shortcut ‚åò+<em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is the project as it appears in Timery‚Äôs list. This will start a timer going for the project so I can track my time. I typically only use this for clients that I‚Äôm working with on a large project or have a regular maintenance contract with; for smaller ad hoc work I‚Äôll instead throw an alert to remind me to start a timer manually.</p>

<p>The second block will open a URL in Safari to any website I might find relevant. This is typically a Jira or Trello board but can sometimes be to some API documentation, a GitHub issue pages, or even a local URL to open up a list in Things.</p>

<p>The third block is very specific to my hardware setup. I have an ultrawide monitor that I use as my primary display and then a 4K Dell monitor in portrait orientation to the side that I typically use for browsing and iOS simulators. This code tells Safari to move to that portrait monitor and then switch to full screen mode.</p>

<p>The final line opens up the Xcode project. I usually work in fullscreen mode on my primary monitor so it‚Äôll typically move to a new space automatically without me needing to program that in.</p>

<p>With this simple script, I can press a single button to get everything configured. It‚Äôs probably only saving me 20 seconds of time but psychologically it lets me jump immediately into a project.</p>

    <figure>Opening a project directory.</figure>
</div>

<p>Another minor hassle I encounter on a daily basis is opening up the directory where all of a project‚Äôs files are stored. I‚Äôll typically do this if I need to look at some artwork I‚Äôve saved or some documentation so I have a very simple script to open up the current project directory:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-applescript" data-lang="applescript"><span class="nb">do shell script</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"open ~/Files/Clients/UKTV/"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is again a psychological improvement as I hate wasting time digging down through Finder to get to the location I need.</p>

<p>So far I‚Äôve only made minor improvements to my productivity but this last button saves me a huge amount of time; automated building. Whilst many developers will handle this task with some form of Continuous Integration or using the new Xcode Cloud feature, this typically doesn‚Äôt work well for me due to the number of projects I‚Äôm involved with at any one time. Instead, I use <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> to perform a wide array of tasks at once such as increasing build numbers, pushing to GitHub, building, and uploading to TestFlight.</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt go through this line by line but the basic idea is that it will prompt me to ask whether this is a new version of the app or a new build; if the former, the version is updated to the one specified and the build number set to 1 across all targets; if the latter, then I just bump the build number. Once that is done, a version string is created that looks something like <em>v1.2.3-b2</em> which I will use later in the workflow; this string is saved to a temporary file so the original Fastfile can reference it.</p>

<p>With the version and build number updated, the script then commits the changes to Git, tags them, and pushes them to the remote branch if one was specified.</p>

<p>The code resumes in the Fastfile with an Xcode build command (which stores the build and it‚Äôs dSYMs in a local directory), an upload to TestFlight, and the uploading of the dSYMs to the Crashlytics service.</p>

<p>With this system in place, I can press one button to have the entire build process execute in the background. This is hugely important to me as I can start work on another project whilst this process plays out; on the Mac Studio I don‚Äôt even notice anything is happening as the build process doesn‚Äôt come close to maxing out the CPU.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this Fastlane system is that I can make it bespoke for projects that need something a little different. Here, for example, is the file for a Catalyst project I work on:</p>

<p>This one is a lot more involved but the basic steps are very similar:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up the configuration that is needed</li>
  <li>Select Xcode, check the repo is clean, and bump the version number</li>
  <li>Do another Git push to a different repo</li>
  <li>Build the macOS version of the app, zip it, and upload it to an Amazon S3 instance</li>
  <li>Build the iOS version of the app</li>
  <li>Upload the dSYMs to Crashlytics for both versions</li>
  <li>Upload each version to TestFlight</li>
</ol>

<p>The process typically takes about 20 minutes to run but would take longer if I were doing it manually as there are multiple points that would require user interaction. That I can press one button and have this run seamlessly in the background is of huge benefit to me, especially if I‚Äôm doing multiple builds in a single day.</p>

<p>I also have a client that has 6 apps that all come from the same codebase. Again, I can press one button and have all 6 of those apps compiled and uploaded; it also automatically submits each app to the App Store once the builds have finished processing!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm planning on extending this further in the future as I create a HTML page for some clients which gives a changelog for each build based on the commit messages. At the moment I do this manually but I could easily automate that with AppleScript and hook it into this process.</p>

    <figure>My Stream Deck homescreen</figure>
</div>

<p>The final thing to mention is the Stream Deck homescreen itself. I have a folder for each project denoted by their app icon which then goes into the start / build commands detailed above. There is also a STOP button will stop any Toggl timer that is currently running and a sleep button that will turn off the Stream Deck display.</p>

<p>I have been incredibly impressed with the Stream Deck as an input device and think it can be an incredibly valuable tool for any app developer that works on multiple projects. All of the above can be achieved by just running an AppleScript file (as that is what the Stream Deck is doing) but I find the tactile nature of the device to be incredibly rewarding and I know there is a ton more I‚Äôm going to do with it over time.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve created an <a href="https://www.thedododeveloper.com/p/1-the-setup">initial introductory post</a> going through some of the motivations for this move and listing some of the items on my ‚ÄúTo do‚Äù list but the aim is to produce a new issue every 2 weeks.</p>

<p>I like to use my main website for either announcing new releases or providing code-level tutorials; the newsletter will be slightly different in that it will be showcasing things <em>way</em> before they are necessarily ready for prime time. This has two main benefits in that working akin to a 2-week sprint cycle will hopefully motivate me to proceed with the numerous app ideas that are half-finished on my hard drive; on the flip side, it will also hopefully generate some much needed feedback during the development process as I‚Äôm planning to invite subscribers to early access betas of new apps and major updates to existing apps. This all begins next week when I‚Äôll be going into detail with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Music Library Tracker</a> upgrade that introduces Spatial Audio matching as well as showing off a new dice-based game mechanic I‚Äôve created for a ‚ÄúChoose your own Adventure‚Äù style game.</p>

<p>As we head into 2023 I‚Äôm determined to try and spend more of my time on my independent projects. By subscribing to the newsletter, you‚Äôll be directly boosting my motivation towards that aim and hopefully getting an insight into how a developer forms an idea into a digital reality.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be landing in your inbox for the first issue next week!</p>

				<h1><a href="/weblog/2022/07/12/chaise-longue-to-5k/">'Chaise Longue to 5K' and porting a tvOS app built with UIKit to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS</a></h1>
			
			<time datetime="2022-07-12" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2022/07/12/chaise-longue-to-5k/">July 12, 2022</a></time>

			<p>A little while ago, my chiropractor recommended that I take up the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/running-and-aerobic-exercises/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/">Couch to 5K</a>‚Äù program in order to improve my fitness in a way that wouldn‚Äôt see me literally running before I could walk. It was a huge success and I was able to lose a significant amount of weight and improve my overall health. Unfortunately, the 2020 lockdowns and the birth of a new child meant most of that effort was undone and I found myself once again needing to embark on a gradual increase in exercise.</p>

<p>One of the key features of Couch to 5K is that you do intermittent bursts of running and walking; for example, in the first week you‚Äôll do three runs consisting of alternating 60 seconds of running (x8) and 90 seconds of walking (x7) sandwiched between a 5 minute warm up and cool down. To keep track of this, I used the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/one-you-couch-to-5k/id1082307672">free NHS Couch to 5K app</a> which tells you what to do at each stage via an audio voiceover which also offers encouragement throughout your run. This worked well for me as I listened to music whilst doing my runs, but nowadays I prefer to run whilst watching TV shows or YouTube videos on an Apple TV in front of my treadmill. For this use case, audio interruption wasn‚Äôt necessarily what I wanted, especially as I was already vaguely familiar with the different run timings. Instead, I wanted an app on my Apple TV that could show me my run progress in a Picture in Picture window.</p>

<p>Introducing ‚Äú<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaise-longue-to-5k/id1633434180">Chaise Longue to 5K</a>‚Äù (after all, couches are <em>so</em> common):</p>

<div class="gofigure">

    </a>
    <figure>Frasier, the discerning runner's choice.</figure>
</div>

<p>The idea is straightforward enough; you open the app to a grid showing all of the available runs<sup id="fnref:wireframe" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wireframe" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and then navigate to a fullscreen running page with a timer and coloured blocks that show what you should be doing. This can then be shrunk down into a Picture in Picture window so you can see the critical information whilst you watch something else.</p>

<p>Originally I‚Äôd planned to use the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AVPictureInPictureController.init(contentSource:)</code> API that was introduced with tvOS 15.0 as that would allow me to fairly easily render the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView</code> of the run screen into the PiP window; unfortunately, there is a <a href="https://github.com/jazzychad/PiPBugDemo">bug with tvOS</a> which prevents that from working and is still present in the tvOS 16 betas.</p>

<p>My next plan was to have the app render a video of the run on the fly. Essentially I would display the running UI, snapshot it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView.drawHierarchy(in rect: CGRect, afterScreenUpdates afterUpdates: Bool)</code>, and then pipe the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIImage</code> into an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AVAssetWriter</code> at 1 second intervals to generate a video. Unfortunately that proved too intensive for the Apple TV hardware (especially the non-4K model) with the render taking a couple of minutes for each video. However, as I‚Äôd already built the render pipeline, I instead updated the system to generate all of the videos sequentially and store them; I then ran that in the tvOS Simulator to generate the 12 videos<sup id="fnref:chaisevideos" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:chaisevideos" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and then bundled them in the app. Much easier ü§£</p>

<p>The final part was to add a button to the top of the run selector page that would show you your next run. To do this, I store the week and number of the last run that was completed<sup id="fnref:cooldown" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cooldown" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore</code>; this is a similar API to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserDefaults</code> with the advantage that it is synced through the user‚Äôs iCloud account meaning it‚Äôll survive reinstallations or switching to a new Apple TV without restoring from backup.</p>

<p>However, that led to an interesting idea. Could I port this to other platforms? And if I could, would I be able to <a href="https://twitter.com/bendodson/status/1544599673943609345">do it in a single day</a>?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<div class="gofigure">  
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaise-longue-to-5k/id1633434180">

</div>

<p>Despite using UIKit rather than SwiftUI, I was able to port everything over to iPhone, iPad, and Mac within 5 hours or so. I started by rejigging the project files so shared code would be separate from the xib files I use for the interface. I then added a new target for iOS and went through the laborious process of recreating the xib files; unfortunately tvOS and iOS xibs are incompatible even so far as you can‚Äôt copy and paste standard elements like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UILabel</code> between them.</p>

<p>The design was such that it was quite easy to make it work for iPhone. The run page itself just needed some font size adjustments whilst the grid view showing all of the runs had some stack views tweaked so they were shown vertically rather than horizontally.</p>

<p>The next step was to optimise the design for iPad. Again, this mostly worked out of the box as I use AutoLayout for everything. I just needed to monitor trait changes and update the code to render slightly differently depending on whether we were in compact or regular width mode. This had the nice side effect of enabling the three column layout on an iPhone 13 Pro Max in landscape and also working across the various split screen views that are available on iPad.</p>

<p>Finally, I checked the box for Catalyst support for macOS and was surprised to find that everything pretty much worked out of the box. I only needed to add the following code to get the app looking just fine on the Mac:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="cp">#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">titlebar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">windowScene</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">titlebar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">titlebar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">titleVisibility</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hidden</span>
        <span class="n">titlebar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">toolbar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">nil</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">windowScene</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sizeRestrictions</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">minimumSize</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">CGSize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">768</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That code effectively hides the toolbar so the traffic light window management buttons blend into the app view and then restricting the minimum view size to that of a regular iPad so you can‚Äôt break the layout<sup id="fnref:catalyst" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:catalyst" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>With that done, I then went through the app and added a few quality of life improvements such as a native menu bar on the Mac, keyboard shortcuts for Mac and iPad, and adding the ability for PiP to automatically engage when you leave the app during a run on iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p>SwiftUI would undoubtedly have made the UI faster to port, but I still think the platform is too immature for full app development. As <a href="https://twitter.com/richturton/status/1469320087844933638">Richard Turton put it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SwiftUI allows you to move so incredibly fast that by the time you realise what you want isn‚Äôt yet possible, you‚Äôre already off the edge of the cliff, like Wile E Coyote</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That certainly matches my experience ü§£. Whilst it can be a phenomenally quick tool for building UI, it can‚Äôt quite match the smooth experience that users expect when it comes to the small but crucial details.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I‚Äôve said many times before, one of the great joys of being a software developer is that you can build apps bespoke for your own needs and interests. I‚Äôve massively enjoyed having Chaise Longue to 5K on my Apple TV whilst doing my runs, but I also really enjoyed the challenge of porting the app across to all the other Apple platforms that support Picture in Picture<sup id="fnref:applewatchchaise" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:applewatchchaise" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. As ever, there are a number of small details that I‚Äôd like to highlight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst adding extra platforms didn‚Äôt take that long from a development point of view, it massively increased the amount of time preparing for App Store submission as I had to create a lot more screenshots, text, etc. Trying to work out the best way to show PiP on macOS was an <a href="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/chaise-longue-macos-pip.png">interesting challenge</a>! It was also difficult to work out a way to <a href="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/chaise-longue-to-5k-pip.jpg">show it on tvOS</a> without using copyrighted video content.</li>
  <li>A nice side effect of using the same bundle identifier for all three versions of the app (Apple TV, iOS/iPadOS, Mac) is that if you buy it on one platform you get it on all of them! As I‚Äôm selling it for ¬£1.79 currently, that makes it a pretty sweet deal‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>I spent quite a lot of time on a little animation effect that happens when you first complete a 5K run. Confetti in front of and behind a real time blur that animates seamlessly. <a href="https://twitter.com/bendodson/status/1543969870810857477">Beautiful</a>.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm really pleased with how the Apple TV app icon <a href="https://twitter.com/bendodson/status/1542450900622626819">came out</a> as I‚Äôm always a big fan of the parallax effects you can create. I found a very cheap designer on Fiverr who created a <a href="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/chaise-longue-fiverr.png">first pass</a> and then I tweaked it to match my needs; I can‚Äôt draw to save my life but I can recompose and recolor objects pretty well!</li>
  <li>I was amazed that all of the Picture in Picture stuff just worked across all the platforms; I didn‚Äôt have to change any code whatsoever and whilst the videos were rendered from the tvOS app UI they look good on all platforms.</li>
  <li>Thanks to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore</code> coupled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.didChangeExternallyNotification</code>, completing a run on one device will see the UI automatically update on all other devices within seconds. No 3rd party frameworks or private data collection required!</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôd love it if you would give <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaise-longue-to-5k/id1633434180">Chaise Longue to 5K</a> a try. It‚Äôs available now on tvOS 14 and above, iOS / iPadOS 14 and above, and macOS Big Sur (11.0) and above. One low price unlocks it across all platforms.</p>

			<p>I love Spatial Audio. The sound quality and the balance of the individual audio elements is truly extraordinary and a huge advantage for Apple Music over other streaming services. But the process of <em>finding</em> supported tracks is‚Ä¶ well, a bit rubbish.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are 3 ways to discover Spatial Audio tracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using Apple‚Äôs own <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/curator/apple-music-spatial-audio/1564180390">curated category</a> which features a number of playlists and a rotating list of songs that have been added to the service. This is only a very small subset of all of the tracks though and requires a lot of scrolling and trying to work out what is new and what isn‚Äôt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going to an <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/songs-about-jane/1440851650">album page</a> on Apple Music and seeing if it shows the Dolby Atmos logo. This only works if the entire album is available in Spatial Audio; it can‚Äôt tell you if individual tracks are available (something which my <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/apple-music-artwork-finder/">Apple Music Artwork Finder</a> can do!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Playing songs in your library; if they have Spatial Audio, it‚Äôll kick in and show a Dolby Atmos logo. This obviously only works on a song-by-song basis and is therefore very slow.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now there is a better way. Introducing the <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/spatial-audio-finder/">Spatial Audio Finder</a>, the quickest way to see which tracks by your favourite artists are available in Spatial Audio:</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/spatial-audio-finder.gif" width="800" height="657" />
</div>

<p>So how does this work? At WWDC 2022, Apple made a small change to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/">Apple Music API</a> such that it is now possible to request <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/songs/attributes">audioVariants</a> as an extended attribute on songs and albums. Within this are such things as Lossless Audio, Dolby Audio, and Dolby Atmos (which denotes Spatial Audio). Whilst I would like to be able to just see Dolby Atmos as a flag on songs within my library, this new API method at least can get me the information via a fairly laborious process. Essentially, I scrape these data points and build up my own database which I can then query very quickly.</p>

<p>To begin with, I built a system which would accept an Apple Music identifier for a song; it would then fetch the album that song belongs to in order to get a full list of all the tracks along with whether they support Spatial Audio or not<sup id="fnref:examplesong" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:examplesong" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I then store this information in my database along with a ‚Äúlast checked‚Äù flag. My script runs continuously and will check to see if there are any songs present that have not been checked in the past 2 weeks and do not have Spatial Audio. If a song or album gains Spatial Audio status, then I tweet it via a new account; <a href="https://twitter.com/NewSpatialAudio">@NewSpatialAudio</a><sup id="fnref:newspatialaudio" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:newspatialaudio" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>With this in place, it becomes trivial to build up the database as I just need to throw in a load of song identifiers and the script will churn away fetching all of the information and actually expanding it to more songs as it will gather the entire album. I began by importing my entire music library which is relatively simple thanks to my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Music Library Tracker</a> app which allowed me to collect all of my song identifiers in a matter of milliseconds. I have 7508 songs in my library but as many of them are single tracks from albums, my script expanded this out to over 16000 tracks (of which around 1000 had support for Spatial Audio).</p>

<p>This is obviously skewed to my musical preferences so the next step was to add the various Spatial Audio playlists that Apple curates. I‚Äôve stored the identifiers of all of their playlists from ‚Äú<a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/made-for-spatial/pl.154af9931b214278a64274c410046e69">Made for Spatial Audio</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/hits-in-spatial-audio/pl.ba2404fbc4464b8ba2d60399189cf24e">Hits in Spatial Audio</a>‚Äù to ‚Äú<a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/jazz-in-spatial-audio/pl.efbd24628ff04ff3b5e416a6e237d753">Jazz in Spatial Audio</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/bollywood-in-spatial-audio/pl.74a13ae85e1f48dbb4a2804bd7660cbb">Bollywood in Spatial Audio</a>‚Äù. These playlists helpfully have a ‚Äúlast updated‚Äù flag on them so I check them frequently but only fetch all of their track identifiers if they have changed. This added another 20000 tracks of which most were compatible with Spatial Audio<sup id="fnref:outliers" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:outliers" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>At this point I was able to see which songs in my library were updated to Spatial Audio and also see new releases and when my tracks got upgraded thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/NewSpatialAudio">@NewSpatialAudio</a> account. As every change thus far had been tweeted, it was possible to search Twitter for specific artists to see what songs or albums were compatible doing something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from:newspatialaudio "avril lavigne"</code><sup id="fnref:sk8erboi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sk8erboi" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Unfortunately, it turned out this was only working when I was logged in as @NewSpatialAudio and results were mixed if searching from different accounts. I don‚Äôt know if this is due to spam protection or some form of caching but it meant there was a need for a new tool; <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/spatial-audio-finder/">Spatial Audio Finder</a>.</p>

<p>Creating the Spatial Audio Finder was relatively easy as I had all the building blocks in place. You enter an artist name and hit search, then I look up all the tracks in my database and list the songs that have been updated. In the end it took a bit longer as I realised I‚Äôd want to have the album artwork and track numbers on the page, and I wasn‚Äôt currently collecting that information; this would need to be added to my data necessitating a full re-fetch of the nearly 40000 tracks. I also decided that it was likely people might search for an artist that was not in my database. To remedy that, if a search is made and there are zero results, I go and fetch the top 25 songs for that artist on Apple Music and add their identifiers to the database which will typically expand out to their most popular albums which are the likeliest candidates for upgraded audio<sup id="fnref:michael" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:michael" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. In this way, the more that people use this tool, the more Spatial Audio tracks will be discovered.</p>

<p>I hope that the <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/spatial-audio-finder/">Spatial Audio Finder</a> will be useful to many people, but this is just a stop gap solution. My ultimate goal is to be able to scan your music library and then show you the tracks that have been updated to Spatial Audio then go a step further and generate a Spatial Audio playlist for you that gets updated automatically as new songs get upgraded on the service. The first step of this will be happening very soon as I release a new version of my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Music Library Tracker</a> app that will allow you to opt-in to upload your library to the Spatial Audio database; the next step after that will be showing you what tracks in your library have been updated! This will in turn expand the musical variety being placed into the database and showcase more Spatial Audio tracks. Eventually, I should have the most complete record of Spatial Audio tracks outside of Apple and also the fastest and most useful ways of accessing that data.</p>

			<time datetime="2022-05-17" pubdate=""><a href="/weblog/2022/05/17/unlisted-app-distribution-on-the-app-store/">May 17, 2022</a></time>
    	</header>
    	<div>
			<p>Back in 2015 I was commissioned to rebuild an iOS app for <a href="https://www.models1.co.uk">models1</a>, the leading modelling agency in Europe. The app performed double duty acting as a personal portfolio for models within the agency and a collection of all of the portfolios for the agents. As it was only for staff and models, the app was distributed via an Enterprise certificate which allowed me to generate a single .ipa and produce a website where users could download the app directly to their devices. Over the years, this process became slightly more arduous as the user would need to manually approve the enterprise certificate within their device settings but it worked.</p>

<p>A little while later I also built a small app that allowed talent scouts to choose multiple photos and fill out some details in a form which was then compiled into an email. This, again, was distributed via an Enterprise account.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2022 and my client had allowed their developer account to lapse. Upon trying to renew, they were told by Apple that they no longer met the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/">current program requirements</a> and that they should seek to distribute via Apple Business Manager, Ad Hoc Distribution, TestFlight, or the App Store. The Apple Business Manager would not have worked well as that is essentially a full MDM system whereby the client would need to manage all devices (which would not be suitable for the models). Similarly, Ad Hoc Distribution would be a pain as we‚Äôd need UDIDs for every device we want to distribute to and TestFlight would require sending out new builds every 90 days; the App Store being public would not be an option given the niche aspect of the app.</p>

<p>Luckily I‚Äôd remembered that Apple had announced a new ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù status back in January which would allow you to upload your app to the App Store but make it available only via a direct link, kind of like the public link system within TestFlight<sup id="fnref:noexpire" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:noexpire" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I browsed around App Store Connect but could find no mention of it within the ‚ÄúPricing and Availability‚Äù tab which only allowed me to go down the business route. It turns out you have to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/unlisted-app-distribution/">apply for unlisted status</a> via a form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You‚Äôll need to submit a request to receive a link to your unlisted app. <strong>If your app hasn‚Äôt been submitted for review or was already approved for public download on the App Store, simply complete the request form</strong>. If your app was already approved for private download on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, you‚Äôll need to create a new app record in App Store Connect, upload your binary, and set the distribution method to Public before completing the request form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To start with, I uploaded a build and filled out all of the metadata on App Store Connect including screenshots, description, review notes, etc. I then attempted to fill out <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/unlisted-app/">the form</a> but was denied access, despite being an admin, as it is only available to the account holder. For reference, the questions they ask are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>App Name</li>
  <li>Apple ID of App</li>
  <li>Describe in detail the business problem your app solves</li>
  <li>Why do you prefer to distribute this app unlisted on the App Store instead of privately to specific organizations on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated size of your app‚Äôs user base?</li>
  <li>Who is the audience for your app?</li>
  <li>In what regions will your app be available?</li>
</ul>

<p>My client filled this out and within 24 hours they had a reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After careful review, we regret that we‚Äôre unable to approve your request for unlisted app distribution at this time.</p>

  <p>In order to evaluate your app, please complete all the required metadata in App Store Connect, including app name, description, keywords, and screenshots and submit for review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a surprise as everything was set up on App Store Connect. After another email back and forth, Apple replied with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will reiterate the note below, and say that all unlisted apps must be submitted for App Store review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it turns out you <em>do</em> need to still submit the app via App Store Connect but also fill in a request form. Obviously we did not want the app to go live publicly so I set everything to ‚ÄúManual release‚Äù and then added an extra line to the review notes that read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IMPORTANT: We will request ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù status for this app, it is not for general release but we were told by unlistedapp_request@apple.com that we needed to submit this to App Review before requesting this status.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I submitted the app and my client filled out the request form again. The next day, I received notification that both apps had been rejected by App Review for <em>Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need more information about your business model and your users to help you find the best distribution option for your app</p>

  <p>Please review the following questions and provide as much detailed information as you can for each question.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Is your app restricted to users who are part of a single company? This may include users of the company‚Äôs partners, employees, and contractors.</li>
    <li>Is your app designed for use by a limited or specific group of companies?
      <ul>
        <li>If yes, which companies use this app?</li>
        <li>If not, can any company become a client and utilize this app?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What features in the app, if any, are intended for use by the general public?</li>
    <li>Identify the specific countries or regions where you plan to distribute your app.</li>
    <li>How do users obtain an account?</li>
    <li>Is there are any paid content in the app? For example, do users pay for opening an account or using certain features in the app?</li>
    <li>Who pays for the paid content and how do users access it?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You‚Äôll note that a lot of this is similar to the form that was already filled out ü§î</p>

<p>I was out of the office for the day so had not gotten around to replying to these questions when out of the blue I got two notifications to say the apps had been approved for the App Store! It looks like App Review had rejected the app as they were not suitable for App Store release (hence the questions above) but had completely ignored my note about the unlisted status. Then, later that day, the team that deals with unlisted apps looked at them and approved them.</p>

<p>When I went back to App Store Connect, it now showed a new ‚ÄúUnlisted App URL‚Äù within the ‚ÄúApp Distribution Methods‚Äù on the Pricing and Availability page<sup id="fnref:manual" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:manual" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/unlisted-app-url.jpg" width="600" height="150" />
</div>

<p>A few thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This process is not great and I‚Äôm not sure why they‚Äôve decided to split it across two separate systems. It would surely make more sense to have ‚ÄúUnlisted‚Äù be an option within App Store Connect and then App Review can have the correct team contact you to ask whatever questions they need, especially as the distribution is done through App Store Connect.</li>
  <li>The documentation clearly says you only need to fill out the form if the app hasn‚Äôt been submitted for review. I‚Äôm not sure why we needed to submit the app only for it to be rejected by a different team?</li>
  <li>The ‚ÄúUnlisted App URL‚Äù you get is actually the same as what the public URL would be. This strikes me as odd, especially as you can convert an already public app into an unlisted one (though you can‚Äôt go back to being public). Those URLs are going to be cached by search engines, etc, so seems like a bit of a flaw. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for us but worth mentioning.</li>
  <li>Viewing the app on the App Store is exactly the same as if you‚Äôd shared any public URL; the store page is identical with screenshots, description, ratings, App Privacy, etc. There is no indication whatsoever that this is a private page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall I like that this system exists and that there is a way to get apps to a very specific small audience without paying 3x the cost for an enterprise account or going through the Apple Business Manager. I was also pleasantly surprised that the very basic app for talent scouts was approved as I did not think it would be; it looks like the App Store Guidelines are much less strictly enforced than they are for a public release<sup id="fnref:lucky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lucky" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. However, there are clearly some teething problems that need to be ironed out.</p>

<p>In any case, if you‚Äôre looking to get an unlisted app on the App Store, just be aware that a rejection may not necessarily be all it seems!</p>

      <p>Similar, but App Store apps don‚Äôt typically expire so a single build would be enough until iOS changes necessitate another build.¬†<a href="#fnref:noexpire" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:manual" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>As the app was still set to ‚ÄúManual release‚Äù I had to press the release button.

    	<div>
			<p>Over the past few weeks I‚Äôve worked on a number of projects that have necessitated me working with HTML and JavaScript be that via Safari on iOS, an SFSafariViewController, or in an embedded WKWebView. In all of these cases, I‚Äôve needed to dive into the DOM to see what styles are being applied to certain elements or dig into a JavaScript Console to work out why some code isn‚Äôt working. On desktop, this is trivial as Safari has a Web Inspector panel built in similar to other browsers. It turns out it is also trivial on mobile as the exact same tool can be used with both iOS simulators and physical devices.</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/ios-simulator-web-inspector.jpg" width="800" height="536" />
    <figure>Activating the Web Inspector for Safari in an iOS Simulator. Note that it is also possible to look at the "Extension Background Page" for the Browser Note Safari Extension that is also installed and running.</figure>
</div>

<p>If you select the ‚ÄòDevelop‚Äô tab from the menu bar of Safari on macOS, you‚Äôll see a list of all of your connected devices and actively running simulators<sup id="fnref:naming" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Drilling into this will then show all of the active web instances you can interact with; notice how the content within Safari has highlighted blue within the Simulator as I‚Äôve moused over the twitter.com web instance above. When you click, a web inspector panel is then produced which allows you to make all the usual interrogations and changes you can within desktop Safari such as interacting with the console or changing CSS values of elements to see how they would look in realtime.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example using a WKWebView within one of my client projects, <a href="https://spanish.yabla.com">Yabla Spanish</a>:</p>

<div class="gofigure">
    <img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/ios-device-web-inspector.jpg" width="800" height="400" />
    <figure>As I hover over the DOM in the web inspector, the same highlighting that appears in desktop Safari appears within the WKWebView on my physical device (note the green box showing the 24px padding within that div).</figure>
</div>

<p>Discovering that simulators and devices could be interacted with in this way has been a huge timesaver for me. Whilst <a href="/weblog/2022/03/11/browser-note/">developing Browser Note</a>, I was constantly needing to tweak CSS values and investigate the current state of the DOM as websites have various tricks to try and make ads or cookie notices appear on top of all content (and the note needed to be on top at all times - you should totally take a look at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/browser-note/id1613527249">Browser Note</a> whilst you‚Äôre here). In doing this, I was then able to put this knowledge to use on no less than 3 client projects in the past month; this validates my theory that by working on your own <a href="/sideprojects/">side projects</a> you can improve your efficiency when it comes to work projects.</p>

<p>There are a few caveats to be aware of when using the Web Inspector with an iOS device or simulator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to use this on an actual device you‚Äôll first need to enable the Web Inspector on iOS. To do this, go to the Settings app and then Safari &gt; Advanced and toggle the Web Inspector on.</li>
  <li>Whilst the Web Inspector can interrogate WKWebView, it can only do this for apps you are running via Xcode. You cannot look at the WKWebView of apps you did not create nor of your own apps from TestFlight / the App Store. However, you can inspect debug builds installed via Xcode even if the debugger is not active (i.e. you build to the device then quit Xcode).</li>
  <li>Conversely, you can use the Web Inspector with any SFSafariViewController even if it is not in your own app.</li>
  <li>Whilst it is still possible to submit apps that use UIWebView, the web inspector will not work with them; <a href="https://bendodson.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/weblog/2022/wkwebview.jpg">it needs to be WKWebView</a>.</li>
  <li>This also works for AppKit, SwiftUI, and Catalyst apps on macOS.</li>
</ul>

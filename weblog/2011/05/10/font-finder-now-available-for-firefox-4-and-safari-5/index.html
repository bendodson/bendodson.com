			<p>Many of you will be familiar with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/">Font Finder</a>, one of my first Firefox Extensions.  The purpose of Font Finder was to display information about the selected font within your browser including information like size, line-height, color, etc. It also went further by not only showing you the font-family stack, but also determining which one was actively being rendered on your machine (as the font you see might be different to other users depending on your installed fonts).</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that as of today, Font Finder is now available as a <a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/browser-extensions/font-finder.safariextz">Safari 5 Extension</a>.  It has also been updated to be fully compatible with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/">Firefox 4</a>.  I'm not planning on building it for any other browsers (e.g. IE9, Chrome) but if you have any suggestions for improvements to either version, please <a href="https://bendodson.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>This is just the first step in porting Font Finder to Safari 5 and I will shortly be releasing an update which makes full use of the Safari UI rather than containing everything within an alert box - I will also be adding a lot more information, particularly around CSS 3.</p>

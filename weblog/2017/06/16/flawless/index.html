			<p>One of the great things about Twitter is the way it can connect you to other developers. For many years, Iâ€™ve been chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaDziuba">Lisa Dziuba</a> and she got in touch with me last year along with her colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/ahmed_sulajman">Ahmed Sulaiman</a> to tell me about a new app they were working on, <a href="https://flawlessapp.io">Flawless</a>, which has now officially launched.</p>

<p>Flawless is an absolute godsend for developers working on pixel perfect designs. It is a plugin for the iOS simulator that allows you to compare what is rendering on screen with a static image via various different modes and a slider for opacity. In this way, you can make sure that what you have built matches the image precisely. The app is a plugin for the simulator itself so you donâ€™t need to add any extra code or frameworks to your project. It also works with static images<sup id="fnref:plugin"><a href="#fn:plugin" class="footnote">1</a></sup> so you donâ€™t need to worry how your designs are provided be that by Sketch, Photoshop, or other<sup id="fnref:indesign"><a href="#fn:indesign" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to be both a beta tester and to be interviewed by Lisa and Ahmed about my workflows to help them tweak the app. If you are an app developer that has to work to a fixed design, you should definitely check it out. Flawless is <a href="https://gum.co/SyRKm">available for macOS</a> at the bargain price of $15<sup id="fnref:price"><a href="#fn:price" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and you can find out more (and get a free trial) on their website at <a href="https://flawlessapp.io">flawlessapp.io</a>.</p>

    <li id="fn:plugin">
      <p>I believe the original idea was to be integrated with Sketch but after they spoke with me and many other developers who donâ€™t work exclusively with Sketch they decided to pivot to being an iOS simulator plugin instead.Â <a href="#fnref:plugin" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:indesign">
      <p>I have one client who provides me designs via InDesign and he is also the most likely to create a GitHub issue for a dividing line being 0.5px out of alignment - love ya Niki ðŸ‘ŠÂ <a href="#fnref:indesign" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:price">
      <p>This has saved me so many subsequent bug follow ups that $15 is almost criminally low.Â <a href="#fnref:price" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

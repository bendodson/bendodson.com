			<p>I’m pleased to announce the release of a new client app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drinkcoach+/id849022698?mt=8">DrinkCoach+</a>, that I worked on over the summer:</p>

<p><img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2017/drink-coach.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>I worked on DrinkCoach+ for <a href="http://www.orbismedia.co.uk">Orbis Media</a> as a freelance iOS developer. The app was designed for the Haringey Advisory Group on Alcohol (HAGA) and is designed to help people keep a track of their alcohol intake with measurable goals and monitor any events caused by drinking such as moodswings, cravings, or accidents. This is actually version 3.0 of the app with the previous versions having been created by a different developer. The old code was neither available or desireable and so I rebuilt the app from scratch using Swift 4.0 and the latest iOS SDKs to ensure it was future proofed for any future developer to work on.</p>

<p>The app is optimised for all iPhone and iPad devices (including the iPhone X) and makes use of AutoLayout to scale perfectly across the growing number of screen resolutions and aspect ratios. In terms of functionality, there are a number of interesting technologies used in the app including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Local notifications:</strong> the app can notify you at certain times and even locations to help keep you on track with your goals. This was all done locally on the device so that notifications could be triggered without an internet connection or unreliable push notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Infographic generation:</strong> an infographic detailing how many calories and units you’ve consumed along with your total alcohol expenditure can be displayed in the app and shared as an image.</li>
  <li><strong>Full customisation:</strong> the drinks in the app can be customised with specific units, calories, and pricing information so that they accurately reflect your usual tipple. Drinks can also be dragged and dropped so that your regular drinks are easier to access.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was really great to work with Orbis Media again and I’m confident that people will love the improvements to this version of the app. You can download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drinkcoach+/id849022698?mt=8">DrinkCoach+ on the App Store</a> for free and learn more about it at <a href="http://www.drinkcoach.org.uk">drinkcoach.org.uk</a>.</p>

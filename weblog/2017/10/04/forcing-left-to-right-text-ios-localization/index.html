			<p>Since iOS 6 it has been the case that any localization that utilises a right-to-left language (such as Arabic) will automatically flip your views so that everything scans from right-to-left. Usually this is desireable but there are certain instances where you may want to disable this functionality (such as with a media player that should scrub from left-to-right). I was recently asked by a client to completely disable the right-to-left functionality for all languages as it was causing too many display issues within the app and customers were specifically saying they’d prefer it to scan that way.</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14724767/ios-disable-ui-mirroring-in-xib">general consensus</a> was that I’d need to manually alter<sup id="fnref:manualstoryboard"><a href="#fn:manualstoryboard" class="footnote">1</a></sup> all of my horizontal constraints in order to force them to be left to right rather than leading to trailing which will flip based on localization. In a project with 1000s of these constraints this did not seem a suitable course of action and would require any future developers on the project to keep this in mind when creating new constraints.</p>

<p>Instead, I came across a property added to UIView in iOS 9 named <code>semanticContentAttribute</code>. This allows you to choose <code>unspecified</code> (the default which flips based on localization), <code>playback</code> and <code>spatial</code> which are special cases for media controls or directional controls, and <code>forceLeftToRight</code> and <code>forceRightToLeft</code> which work as their names would suggest. Thanks to the <code>UIAppearance</code> protocol, disabling the flipping globally is a simple one-liner:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span></span><span class="bp">UIView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">appearance</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">semanticContentAttribute</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">forceLeftToRight</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This not only flips all content back to left-to-right but also ensures that your <code>UINavigationController</code> will animate from left-to-right as well. Of course, you can also use the <code>appearanceWhenContainedIn:</code> method to limit this global change to specific view controllers of your app should you wish to or to set certain controls to other directions.</p>

<p>The only other thing I needed to change in my project to get this all working was some paragraph styles for attributed strings. I frequently use <code>NSMutableParagraphStyle</code> to set custom line heights and I leave the other properties to their defaults. One of these is <code>alignment</code> which is always left on my devices due to my English language but the default is actually <code>natural</code> which means it renders depending on the language. Searching through my project and finding the few places I’d left out a default and setting it was fairly trivial:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span></span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">paragraph</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="bp">NSMutableParagraphStyle</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">paragraph</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lineSpacing</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">4.0</span>
<span class="n">paragraph</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">alignment</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">left</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In total, I only needed to make 8 edits to my project; much easier than trying to edit every horizontal constraint in your storyboard!</p>

      <p>If I had gone down that route I likely would have written a build script that would go through every xib and storyboard file and do this for me but I have been burned by manually editing xib files in the past. That’s a young man’s game! <a href="#fnref:manualstoryboard" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

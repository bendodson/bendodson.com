			<p>Some of the more regular visitors amongst you may have noticed that for the past month or so, <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/" title="PHP Developer Ben Dodson">bendodson.com/weblog</a> has been in a mild state of flux - I'm happy to say that everything is now completed and working fully!</p>

<p>I hurried the uploading of the new design as I had some spare time at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bendodson/sets/72157605753188176/" title="Mashed 08 at Alexandra Palace" rel="external">Mashed</a> and thought it would be a good idea to get the new site up and running in any state.  Then, the knowledge that my site might not be working would spur me on to fixing it.  A good theory, but apparently not good in practice.</p>

<p>There were several bugs in IE6 (there always are), the site was taking too long to load, and the contact form didn't work at all.</p>

<p>But now, the site has been optimised to a grade A level (according to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" rel="external">YSlow</a>), the IE6 bugs have been fixed, and email now works from my server so the contact form is working again!</p>

<p>I'll be continuing to make little tweaks and upgrades here and there, but I'll also be returning to the blogging scene and keeping the site regularly updated with various development news.  As a taster, I have recently been playing with a new iPhone 3G, fire eagle, a montage making script that uses flickr, and Google Optimizer (although not all at the same time) so stay tuned!</p>

			<p>I've spent some time updating my firefox extensions so that all of them work with <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html" rel="external">Firefox 3 Beta 3</a>. At present they can only be downloaded from this site as it takes the Mozilla Addons team a few days to approve updates.  My <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/extensions/">extensions page</a> is now back up and running though and contains details on all 3 of my Firefox Extensions (Font Finder, Stop! Hammertime!, and STOP in the name of love) as well as download links for the new releases.</p>

<p>I won't be making any further updates to the stop buttons (apart from making them work with future version of Firefox) but I will be continuing development on Font Finder which could benefit from a visual overhaul as well as a clipboard function!  I'll be updating on here when it happens so sign up to the <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for the latest news!</p>

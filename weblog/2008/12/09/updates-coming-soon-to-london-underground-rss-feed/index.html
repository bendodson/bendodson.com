			<p>I've had a large number of emails over the last week or so about my <a href="https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/03/16/rss-feed-of-the-london-underground-tube-status/">RSS Feed that displays the latest updates from the London Underground</a> asking for more data or for a slightly different service.  I hadn't realised how many people were using the feed (which I put up as a tutorial on how to site scrape and to demonstrate the lack of tools on the new TFL site) until my server nearly died as the access logs had ballooned to 7GB!</p>
<p>So, I'm pleased to say that I'm working on some major updates which will provide not only the current RSS feed but also a full REST API and dedicated site so you can get more data and more flexibility into your applications.</p>
<p>I should have everything ready in the next few days so sign up to my <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> to be notified when the new service goes live!  If you have any suggestions, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>

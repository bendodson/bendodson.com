		<p>I've been making iPhone apps since the introduction of the App Store in July 2008. I have built a number of <a href="/apps/">my own apps</a> (which have been featured by Apple amongst others) and I have built apps for a hugely varied client base; everyone from worldwide brands to one-man businesses. I have consulted on iPad magazines, built top 10 ranking apps (including some that have reached #1 in the App Store), and been featured on national television. In addition to building my own apps, some of them have become businesses in their own right and have been <a href="/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/">successfully acquired</a>. <strong>If you need an iOS developer, then I'm probably what you're looking for.</strong></p>

		<p>I've recently been working on the following apps for my clients:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An iOS app based around a specific channel for a major British broadcaster (currently in private beta).</li>
			<li>Bringing a major language learning brand to Apple TV.</li>
			<li>An iOS app that uses video recording and AI to improve your football skills.</li>
			<li>Building a Catalyst app for a commercial pilot training school.</li>
			<li>An enterprise-level app which connects to a bluetooth medical device for a number of major sporting events (currently in testing phase around the world).</li>
			<li>Multiple iPad games for some of the biggest names in Formula 1 (used privately at F1 events around the world).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Whilst I started out with Objective-C back in 2008, I quickly migrated to Swift when it was introduced in 2014 and used it exlusively from 2015. All of my work currently is written in Swift 5. I never write apps using HTML wrappers; it's a poor user experience. I also only write native apps for Apple's platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. I do not work on Android apps.</p>

		<p>Many of the iOS projects I've worked on for clients over the past few years are on internal systems whilst others are subject to Non-Disclosure Agreements. However, I have compiled a small selection of some of the bigger projects I've been involved with below. You may also want to see the <a href="/apps/">apps I have self published</a>.</p>

		<p>Want to hire me? Take a look at <a href="/apps/">my own apps</a> and then <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>. I am <strong>currently available from July 2022</strong>.</p>

			<h3>UKTV Play</h3>

		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/uktv-app.jpg" width="940" height="470" alt="UKTV Play for Apple TV - Developed by Ben Dodson">
		<p>In January 2019 I started working with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/uktv-play-tv-on-demand/id596009592#?platform=appleTV">UKTV</a> to bring their platform to the Apple TV. Whilst several apps of this nature have been built with TVML templates, I built the app natively in Swift 5 in order that I could match the provided designs as close as possible and have full control over the trackpad on the Siri Remote.</p>
		<p>Features included complex video integrations with FairPlay DRM and preroll / midroll advertising, a custom built caching layer for the rich recommendation engine, Apple TV functionality such as Top Shelf integration, bespoke UI creation alongside the Focus Engine for a dynamic interface, and much more.</p>
		<p>The most exciting aspect for me though was the ability to work with invite-only Apple technology to integrate with the TV app. One of the best moments in the project was when our contact at Apple said "please share my congrats to your tvOS developer; I don’t remember the last time a dev completed TV App integration in just 2 passes".</p>
		<p><em>Please note: I did not work on the iOS version of UKTV Play. Whilst iTunes links both apps together, they are entirely separate codebases built by different teams. I was the sole developer on the tvOS version for Apple TV.</em></p>

			<h3>Revival</h3>
			<p>Truly uncomplicated task planning for everyone</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2019/revival-dark-mode.jpg" width="940" height="705" alt="Revival for iOS">
		<p>Revival is a task management app for everyone. From everyday reminders for work, school and home including family groceries to collaborative team projects and event planning, Revival will delight you with its ease and inspire you to reach your goals.</p>
		<p>I worked with Wonderboy Media throughout 2019 as their sole iOS and iPadOS developer to completely rebuild Revival as a modern iOS 13 compatible app. This was without doubt one of the most complicated projects I've worked on including features such as local notifications (with snoozing), timezones, locations, subtasks, priorities, lists, tags, notes, files, contacts, subscriptions, integration with the iOS Reminders app, and Siri support! In addition, I completely redesigned the app giving it a far more modern look and feel complete with fluid gestures, sounds, and haptics. I even redesigned the app icon!</p>
		<p>One of the most complicated pieces of functionality was a seamless and accountless syncing solution allowing users to update tasks on their iPhone and see that immediately reflected on all of their other devices. This extended to sharing and sending tasks to other users via a secure URL negating the need to collect personal information via an account. Beyond this, there was also a complex theming system that plugged into the new iOS 13 dark mode allowing for the UI to update it's theming at any point. Finally, the app was localised into eight additional languages and a bespoke screenshotting system was built in order to render the 180 screenshots that were needed for the App Store complete with iOS device frames and translations.</p>

			<h3>Brapp</h3>

		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/brapp.jpg" width="940" height="705" alt="Brapp for iPhone">
		<p>Brapp is a free and easy way to create and discover exciting musical collaborations all over the world. Producers can share their beats allowing anyone to make mini music videos right on their phone complete with video filters and custom audio balancing.</p>
		<p>I worked with Brapp throughout 2015 as the sole iOS developer working closely with the app creator and his API developer. I was able to write the app in Swift and use AutoLayout to make sure everything scales beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone. In addition, I made use of GPUImage for the custom video filters and a whole load of low-level audio APIs to get the audio balance just right as well as real time waveforms and switching between external microphones. The design went through a number of iterations, each better than the last, and I was able to use my extensive UX knowledge to help shape the end result.</p>
		<p>I worked with Brapp again in 2016 to develop their v2.0 update. This migrated the app from Swift 1.2 to Swift 2.1, added new features for iOS 9, studio grade Audio FX, and a new beat trimmer that allows producers to import a beat from any iOS app and then trim it to under a minute in length with optional fades in and out. I also worked with them throughout the summer on several updates which included the ability to export beats as videos, major UI updates, and new location-based features.</p>
		<p>Throughout 2017 I worked with Brapp again to add major new features such as a completely redesigned recording process, a new sign up flow, and multiple UI adjustments and functionality enhancements. I also ported the app to Swift 3.2 and Swift 4.0 as well as making improvements for iOS 11.</p>

			<h3>Foodim</h3>
			<p>A food photography social network by Nigella Lawson</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2019/foodim.jpg" width="940" height="705" alt="Foodim for iPhone">
		<p>Back in 2014, I was approached by a team representing Nigella Lawson to work on an app centered around food photography. As a big fan of Nigella, I jumped at the chance and spent several months working on the Foodim app.</p>
		<p>When I first joined the team, there was a basic app that had been built but it wasn't anywhere near polished enough for launch. The custom made blur filter was working but the app would crash from memory constraints after you took a few photos. I started by rebuilding the photo memory subsystem and working on the fundamental basics of the networking. Over time I helped work out UX issues, redesigned various aspects, and helped move some of the camera code over to a newer image processing system including working on the draw-to-blur functionality and improving the gyroscopic tilt mechanic to adapt depth of field. I also used my contacts with Apple Developer Relations to setup a meeting between Apple and Foodim to showcase the app and get their opinion on improvements that could be made.</p>
		<p>Whilst I haven't worked on the app recently (save from answering the occasional question via email), I'm really excited to see it launch and hope that food fans will take to it. The gyroscopic depth of focus is really impressive as is the photo filter; your food shots will look incredible!</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.orbismedia.co.uk/">Orbis Media</a> during 2017 as a solo freelance iOS developer to help rebuild the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drinkcoach+/id849022698?mt=8">DrinkCoach+ app</a>. The app was designed for the Haringey Advisory Group on Alcohol (HAGA) and is designed to help people keep a track of their alcohol intake with measurable goals and monitor any events caused by drinking such as moodswings, cravings, or accidents.</p>
		<p>This is actually version 3.0 of the app with the previous versions having been created by a different developer. The old code was neither available or desirable and so I rebuilt the app from scratch using Swift 4.0 and the latest iOS SDKs to ensure it was future proofed for any future developer to work on. I added a number of interesting features including infographic generation / sharing, local notifications based on time and location, and full customisation of the drinks within the app.</p>
		<p>In 2018, I performed a number of updates including a developmentally complex calendar overview along with a shareable PDF containing data between two dates. There was also an update to Swift 4.2, some UX changes, and some other functional tweaks.</p>

The app is written entirely in Swift 5 and there are several pieces of swiping interactivity and subtle animated bounces to make the app feel right at home in the modern iOS ecosystem. Other Apple technologies used include push notifications, accessing the address book, and a full sharing suite powered by Universal Links allowing the app to be opened directly to specific sections of the app or redirecting a user to the App Store if they don’t have the app installed.</p>

			<h3>Great British Bee Count</h3>
			<p>Help monitor the British bee population</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2017/gbbc-2017.jpg" width="940" height="588" alt="Great British Bee Count for iPhone">
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://twothirdswater.co.uk">Two Thirds Water</a> during Spring 2015 to build a new version of the Great British Bee Count app for their client <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/page/join-great-british-bee-count-today">Friends of the Earth</a>. I built the app from scratch to make use of the Swift language and quickly use features such as AutoLayout to scale their pixel-perfect designs to the various sizes of iPhone. The app allows you to count bees in your local area - these counts are stored locally so that they can be performed offline with synchornisation happening automatically when a network connection appears.</p>
		<p>I was hired again in early 2016 to update the app for the 2016 Bee Count. I added a number of new features such as bee and plant information, an enhanced bee picker, and some design updates along with universal support for both the iPhone and iPad.</p>
		<p>In 2017, I was asked back again to add a number of updates for the 2017 Bee Count. This included a whole new design, more species of bee, new "fact files", and a whole host of new functionality. I rebuilt the entire app from scratch using Swift 3.1 and improved the automatic app resizing to take advantage of some of the new features of iOS 9 and iOS 10 such as stack views and improved storyboards.</p>

		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2017/reactioncam.jpg" width="940" height="588" alt="Reaction Cam for iPhone by freelance app developer Ben Dodson">
		<p>I was hired by Elliott Brock in early-2017 to build Reaction Cam, an easy-to-use app that allows you to quickly record and share your reaction to anything from video to content in a browser. Due to the limitations of iOS sandboxing, this was an immense technical challenge but the end result is incredibly slick with the power to record a reaction and the content on screen at the same time. Once recording is complete, you can edit your reaction and the content with trimming, full picture in picture support, and rotations. A single file is exported at the end of the process for easy sharing with friends on social media.</p>
		<p>I was given a very loose spec and so I designed the app and worked out all of the UX myself. I even designed the app icon! Reaction Cam is built in Swift 3.1 and makes use of the latest features in iOS 10 to allow it to run quickly on all of the various iOS devices with full scaling support for every screen size.</p>
		<p>In 2019 I worked on the biggest update yet including an in-app purchase for a premium subscription, the ability to pause and resume videos whilst reacting to them, headphone audio balancing, outro recording, and a load of other UX improvements.</p>

The app is written entirely in Swift 4.1 and is optimised for all iPhone sizes including the relatively new iPhone X. There are a number of interesting Apple technologies being used including iCloud sync which helps keep the settings the same across all of your devices as well as syncing your favourited trips and recent searches.

		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio.jpg" width="940" height="675" alt="Calm Radio for Apple TV - Developed by Ben Dodson">
		<p>I worked with <a href="https://calmradio.com/">Calm Radio</a> at the end of 2015 to bring their ubiquitous service to the 4th Generation Apple TV. Calm Radio allows you to stream over 150 different channels catering to specific genres of music and relaxation such as meditation, piano, jazz, latin, etc. With the Apple TV, I wanted to make the app fit in like a first class citizen of the platform and so I did all of the design and UX work myself with a focus on real time blurs and gradients. As you navigate around the huge array of channels, the background will subtley shift to softer version of the key colours used in the artwork. When you select a channel, you can choose up to 3 atmospheres to blend with it such as rain, wind, waterfalls, crickets, etc. For this, I designed a simple to understand UX that allows the listener to lower or increase the volume of the atmospheres relative to the main playing channel. There are 12 high definition videos that can be chosen as backgrounds on the Now Playing screen and these too are tinted to match the channel you are listening to. Finally, I wanted to use as many tvOS features as possible and so I built in support for the "Top Shelf" allowing you to see and play various channels direct from the TV home screen.</p>

		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-ios.jpg" width="940" height="752" alt="Calm Radio for iPhone and iPad - Developed by Ben Dodson">
		<p>Once the Apple TV app was finished, the client was so pleased that they asked me to rebuild their universal iPhone and iPad app. In early 2016, I rebuilt their app from scratch (with Swift 2.1) with a number of new features such as an alarm clock, sleep timer, video backgrounds, skip track, favourites, and the ability to stream to a Chromecast. I did all of the design work myself and mimicked the Apple TV app I designed putting emphasis on blurred backgrounds based on the channel artwork. There is full support for AutoLayout with the app working in an incredible 20 different sizes and orientations including landscape iPhone and split-screen modes on the iPad. I also added support for 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s with quick access to your most recently listened channels.</p>
		<p>I'm incredibly pleased with both of these apps and have been using them regularly; Calm Radio for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV is free but some features are limited to paid accounts available from <a href="https://calmradio.com/">calmradio.com</a>.</p>

		<p>The app is available for free and can be used by clinical staff on both iPhone and iPad thanks to a scaling interface suitable for all device sizes. An A4-sized PDF can be generated with the results of each assessment and this can be printed directly from the app. Push notifications were also integrated to inform users quickly of any updates.</p>

			<h3>Sporta</h3>
			<p>Notifications of upcoming football matches</p>
		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/sporta.jpg" width="940" height="600" alt="Sporta for iPhone">
		<p>Sporta is an app to keep football fans up to date with the latest matches via local notifications in advance of a game. You simply select which teams you are interested in from the Premier League, Sky Bet Championship, The FA Cup, the Scottish Premiership, or international matches featuring England, Scotland, Wales, or Ireland. You can then choose a reminder time prior to the match (from 5 minutes up to 1 week) and the app will automatically send you a local notification to remind you about the match with details of kick off time, the teams involved, and the venue.</p>
		<p>I was originally contacted by the creator to update the existing version of Sporta but I found that the code wasn't suitable for me to work with due to a combination of out-dated code and offshore developers with poor documentation. Instead, I proposed that re-building the app from scratch with Swift 3 and modern iOS updates (such as AutoLayout to work on all sizes of iPhone and the new permissions systems for notifications introduced in iOS 10) would actually be faster than trying to untangle what was there. I was quickly able to recreate the app and scale it for different iPhone sizes whilst adding an intelligent system for keeping the app constantly up to date.</p>

			<p>Interesting articles in a minimal design</p>

		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/show-me-the-next.jpg" width="940" height="550" alt="Show Me The Next for iPhone and iPad - Developed by Ben Dodson">
		<p>I worked with <a href="http://thebrowser.com">The Browser</a> at the beginning of 2016 to develop and design their minimalist reading app for iPhone and iPad. The concept is very simple; they wanted an app with curated articles that you read through at random with a simple swipe. I had a quick mockup made and then I added some extra features such as the ability to share articles, alter the font size, and change screen brightness. I also built a simple CMS so that they could update the articles embedded in the app remotely.</p>
		<p>As well as designing the app, I also designed the icon and logo based on the brief "I admire the art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian">Mondrian</a>". I used the same colours and textures but applied them within lines spelling out "SMTN".</p>
		<p>The app runs on all devices with iOS 9 or above and is optimised for all the various shapes and sizes including iPad split screens.</p>
		<p>You can <a href="/weblog/2016/03/15/show-me-the-next/">read more about the development</a> of this app on my blog.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.munchkinreport.com">Munchkin Report</a> at the end of 2015 to develop their first app for their new online service. Munchkin Report helps you track your child's moments, big and small. From her first steps to yesterday's nap schedule, Munchkin Report captures memories, keeps parents and caregivers in-sync, and helps you make informed decisions.</p>
		<p>As the sole iOS developer on the project, I worked closely with the client and API developer of the project in order to bring their vision to life. From API documentation and a basic outline, I had freedom to create the minimalist design and UX that makes Munchkin Report a fast and simple app to use. I made tweaks and changes to the original UX and added additional features such as 3D touch quick actions and "Peek and Pop" throughout the app.</p>
		<p>I'm really pleased with the way this app turned out and I think it'll be a great resource for childcarers and parents. Munchkin Report is free but does require an account from <a href="https://munchkinreport.com/">munchkinreport.com</a> (free trials are available).</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/">Natural Cycles</a> at the end of 2015 to help add an Apple Watch app to the new version of their popular iPhone app. The watchOS app syncs with the iOS app in order to show critical information relating to the fertility tracking and pregnancy planning features as well as reading through received messages. In addition to displaying information, you can also log your current body temperature and menstrual flow from the Apple Watch. To complement the app, I also built in support for Glances, Notifications, and Complications so you can view your information in a multitude of different ways.</p>
		<p>I was the sole Swift developer on the project and had complete control over the Apple Watch app. In addition to the Swift 2.0 code for watchOS, I also wrote some Javascript in order to interface between the Cordova app on which the Natural Cycles iPhone app is based and my native Apple Watch code. The watch is quite limited in terms of UI customisation and functionality and this app stretched the boundaries of both but the end result works incredibly well.</p>

			<h3>Chipp'd</h3>

		</header>
		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-app.jpg" width="940" height="534" alt="Chipp'd for iPhone">
		<p>I worked on <a href="http://chippd.com/">Chipp'd</a> towards the end of 2015 in order to build them a version 2.0 of their app within a very agressive timescale. Chipp'd is an app that works with real world products (available at <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d">John Lewis</a>) to let you share secrets or private messages with your friends. You simply scan the QR code on the gift, create your secret (with video, audio, photos, and text), and send the gift; your friend will then be able to see that secret when they scan it with the app or any other QR scanner. It is also possible to share secrets for free using the app via auto-generated URLs that can be sent via email or SMS.</p>
		<p>I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the CTO of Chipp'd to integrate their existing API into the product. Everything was written in Swift 2.0 and used AutoLayout for flexible layouts on all iPhone screen sizes. I'm particularly proud of the QR scanner which I custom built when it transpired that the products that had been printed and shipped to distributors were too light for a conventional QR scanner to detect; I used GPUImage to manipulate the live video feed with multiple filters per second in order to quickly scan at different brightnesses and solve the problem.</p>

The app was written from the ground up with Swift, uses AutoLayout to render beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone, has iCloud syncing of favourites, and includes an incredibly technically complex iOS 8 keyboard extension. In addition, I built an online admin system so that the packs could be updated, added, and re-ordered remotely without going through the App Store review process. This is all powered by an innovative patch system I developed which allows for small delta updates to minimise bandwidth costs.</p>

		<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.verb.digital">Verb Digital</a> in spring 2015 as the sole iOS developer to develop a unique app for Glenfiddich. The app is part of a large installation to showcase a limited edition of Glenfiddich which is available exclusively at Changhi Airport. The single cask that has been selected by Glenfiddich is on display within a specially constructed glass chamber that showcases the weather and atmospheric conditions of the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. The iPad app allows for customers to see the current conditions in Dufftown including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and the time. This is paired with multiple sound effects which match with the weather conditions. The app also talks with a control PC via a direct socket connection over WiFi in order to control the weather effects within the chamber simulating morning fog, wind, and even rain!</p>
		<p>The app is written entirely in Swift 1.2 and the iPad is locked down with Guided Access to prevent customers accessing anything else. You can see the app at the Glenfiddich Residence store in Changhi Airport for the duration of 2015.</p>

The app uses some innovative technology in order to provide a groundbreaking second screen experience on iPhone and iPad. Each horse within the 3 days of racing at Aintree is fitted with a tracker in order to provide their exact position within their race along with speed and distance data. This is displayed in the app to help you find your horse but the really clever piece is that the app listens to the TV broadcast in order to timesync you perfectly - this is important as the terrestrial broadcast can have up to a 20 second difference depending on where in the country you are and what service you use.</p>
		<p>The app was highly successful with 165,000 unique users during the Grand National whilst reaching <strong>#1 on the App Store</strong>.</p>

			<h3>IslandBreak</h3>

		</header>
		<p>I worked with the founder of IslandBreak during Spring 2014 as their only developer. The app was interesting to work on due to the need for a completely offline experience. This wasn’t limited to just the points of interest and itineraries (which feature a huge amount of beautiful high-resolution photos) but also the map; this was a requirement so that tourists don’t have to use their data plans, particularly in an area which has very poor mobile reception. Getting a full map of the islands complete with multiple zoom levels and the experience you expect on iOS was difficult, but works really well. In addition, I built an online CMS in PHP so that the app content can be updated remotely without going through the App Store approval process.</p>

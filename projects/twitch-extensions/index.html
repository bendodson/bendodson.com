		<p>When I started <a href="https://twitch.tv/ShyGuysTheDod">my Twitch stream</a> in 2018, I spent a lot of time playing with the various panels that are available. The first thing I was keen to do was include some details and tasting notes on the various wines I drink whilst gaming and this ended up being developed into the "Currently Drinking" extension complete with integration with Vivino, Distiller, and Untappd. I later followed this up with three "Wishlist" extensions for the various gaming storefronts that I use; Steam, Humble, and GOG.</p>
		<p>Please feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for enhancements or new extensions. If you find them useful, a <a href="https://twitch.tv/ShyGuysTheDod">follow</a> is always appreciated!</p>

		<p>Currently Drinking is a panel-based extension that lets you show your viewers what you are drinking. Primarily created as a way to share tasting notes of wines or whiskies, you can use it for any kind of beverage. Information about your tipple includes name, type, location, price, ABV%, a description, your notes, and an image. All of this can be entered manually but you can also auto-populate the panel with a URL from Vivino.com (wines), Distiller.com (spirits), or Untappd.com (beers and ciders).</p>

		<img src="https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/twitch-extensions/twitch-wishlist-steam.jpg" width="940" height="470" alt="Steam Wishlist panel extension for Twitch by ShyGuysTheDod">

		<p>This panel extension requires only the URL to your Steam Wishlist and then it will automatically fetch the list of games and display them on your Twitch page. Due to the Twitch Extension rules, the panel is not allowed to link to the Steam store but I'm hoping these restrictions will change in the future.</p>
		<p>Whilst you do not need to authenticate with Steam in any way, you must have the "Game Details" privacy option in Steam set to Public otherwise this extension cannot list your wishlisted games. To do this, go to your profile page on Steam and choose "Edit Profile". Next choose the "My Privacy Settings" tab on the right-hand side and then set the "Game details" section to "Public". Your profile can remain private if you wish, this extension only requires that your wishlist page be publicly visible.</p>

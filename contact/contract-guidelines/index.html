		<h2>iOS / tvOS / watchOS Contract Guidelines</h2>
		<p>The below are just a few rough guidelines to help meet expectations for the majority of enquiries I receive.</p>
		<p>Having worked as a freelancer for several years, I know what sort of business relationship works best for both me and my clients. I have a wealth of experience that means I am not just a developer, but somebody who can help you at the design, UX, development, and marketing stages. I like to get involved early in a project so I can help you avoid costly design mistakes, but also so I can get a good feel for the work that needs to be done. I am incredibly passionate about making "best of breed" products and so I like to be involved at every stage to make sure that I can put across best practices. For this reason (amongst others), I do not work on projects that have been started by another developer unless starting from scratch is an option.</p>
			
		<p>I work remotely from my own office but I am always available via phone, Skype, Slack, and email. I can factor in time to come to your offices for face-to-face meetings but I am far more productive in my own office than on a laptop in a client office. With previous clients in the UK, I have typically gone to their office once every 4 weeks as this strikes the right balance for productive catch up sessions and meetings (although in most cases an hour on Skype would have been more efficient). The majority of my clients over the past few years have been overseas (mainly the USA and Dubai) and I typically keep in touch with these teams via Slack.</p>
			
		<p>All of my client work is offered through my company "Dodo Apps Ltd" and is charged at £500 per day (plus VAT if applicable). This is non-negotiable. I can work on either a fixed-cost (with a formal specification) or day rate basis. I am always upfront about judging how long a piece of work will take and I will make suggestions on how to get best value for your money. All my work follows the principals of agile development and I typically work in 1-2 week sprints with frequent test builds so you can see as work progresses.</p>

		<p>My payment terms are broken down on total value of the project:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>&lt;5 days</strong>: 50% on start, 50% on completion</li>
			<li><strong>5-10 days</strong>: 30% on start, 70% on completion</li>
			<li><strong>&gt;10 days</strong>: 25% on start, 25% at a defined midpoint (usually first prototype build), 50% on completion</li>
		</ul>

		<p>All invoices are expected to be paid within 7 days. <a href="/weblog/2015/12/22/ios-developers-dont-work-for-free/">I never work on an equity or profit-share basis</a>.</p>

		<p>Once a project is complete, I offer a retainer-based service in which I offer a discount of 20% (£400 per day plus VAT if applicable) on the basis of a fixed number of days work per month. These days are paid for in advance on the last day of the previous month and can be rolled over for one month if they are not all used. If more days are required, these can be added on (subject to my availability) at the same cost and will be added to the next invoice.</p>
		
		<p>I receive multiple enquiries per day which means that I am very picky about which clients I work with. I won't generally take on a project if it's longer than 3 months unless it's something I'm very interested in. I also only work on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS projects and will not be available to port your applications to Android, OS X,  Windows Mobile, etc. However, I may be able to build a web-based API for your application with PHP if required.</p>

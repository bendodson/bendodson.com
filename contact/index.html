		<p>If you’d like to get in contact with me for any reason, please email:</p>
		
		<span class="details">
			<a href="mailto:ben@bendodson.com">ben@bendodson.com</a>
		</span>
		
		<p>I aim to get back to all enquries within a few days. If you're curious about the large email addresses, you may want to <a href="/weblog/2010/11/04/contact-forms/">read my blog post</a> about contact pages.</p>

		<p>If you are contacting me about a potential project, please be aware that I charge £600 per day (plus VAT if applicable) and <a href="/weblog/2015/12/22/ios-developers-dont-work-for-free/">I do not work on a profit-share or equity basis on any projects</a>. I also appreciate it if you can read my <a href="/contact/contract-guidelines/">general contract guidelines</a> before getting in touch.</p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
			<p>Due to the number of enquiries I get, I thought it might be useful to list a few guidelines for the most common emails I receive. If your email roughly matches one of the scenarios below, I'd ask you to have a quick look at the linked guidelines as they will answer some frequently asked questions. They also list my current day rates and availability for new projects (if applicable).</p>

			<h3>Contracts / Projects</h3>
			<p>I am <strong>currently available from February 2017</strong> for a short (less than 3 months) contract or project. I'm only interested in remote working opportunities and <strong>my day rate is £600 (plus VAT if applicable)</strong>. I'd appreciate you reading my <a href="/contact/contract-guidelines/">general contract guidelines</a> before making contact so you can see my payment terms and how I work to ensure we are a good fit. I perform all freelance work via my company <strong>Dodo Apps Ltd</strong>. I only work on native iOS, watchOS, and tvOS projects; I do not build Android apps or cross-platform HTML5 apps.</p>

			<h3>Full-time Positions</h3>
			<p>I am not currently interested in any full-time positions or long-term contracts.</p>

			<h3>App Ideas</h3>
			<p>I get a lot of emails about app ideas due to an <a href="/weblog/2009/10/16/how-to-pitch-an-app-idea-to-an-iphone-developer/">article I wrote about pitching app ideas</a> back in 2009. I have had over 900 apps pitched to me since that time and nearly all of them have been poorly thought out with an assumption that an idea is actually worth something; the harsh reality is that an idea is worth absolutely nothing. If you have a wealth of experience in a certain market, you have contacts, and you have a good idea that hasn't been done before, then get in touch and I'll see what I can do (although <a href="/weblog/2015/12/22/ios-developers-dont-work-for-free/">I'm not interested in equity</a>). If you are just a person with 'the next greatest app idea' and nothing else, then I'm not interested.</p>
			
			<h3>My Apps</h3>
			<p>If you have questions, feature requests, or you are experiencing probems with one of <a href="/apps/">my apps</a>, then please email <a href="mailto:support@dodoapps.io">support@dodoapps.io</a> - I'll aim to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
			
			<h3>My Projects</h3>
			<p>All of <a href="/code/">my projects</a> are completely unsupported and are offered free of charge. If you have suggestions for updates, then please get in touch but please bear in mind that I have very little free time so the majority of my projects will not be updated.</p>

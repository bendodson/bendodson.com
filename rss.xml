      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I took the plunge and bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://canary.is&quot;&gt;Canary&lt;/a&gt;, an internet-connected personal security camera and air quality monitoring system. It has been working great so far and comes with a decent iPhone app that allows you to control the camera and have it activate automatically based on location. There are three different operating modes; armed, disarmed, and privacy. Whilst armed, you’ll get a notification when any activity is detected whereas disarmed will still record and store any video when there is motion but it won’t notify you&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:disarmed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:disarmed&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Privacy completely shuts off the camera and microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the simple reason that I don’t want everything that happens in my living room whilst I’m in it to be streamed to a 3rd party server, I have set the iPhone app to switch between armed and privacy modes; this means that if nobody is in the house, it automatically arms itself but will shut off the camera and microphone as soon as a family member gets back home. The problem with this is that the camera is then in privacy mode when we go to bed as obviously our phones are still in the house; if somebody breaks in, we won’t have any video evidence. I can open the iOS app and manually arm the Canary but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod%27s_law&quot;&gt;Sod’s Law&lt;/a&gt; means I’ll probably get an intruder on the night I forget to do that&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:morning&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:morning&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was a scheduling system could be put in place to automatically arm and disarm the Canary if I’m in the house but the app doesn’t have that functionality and there is no public API. I then discovered that Canary have partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wink.com&quot;&gt;Wink&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that allows multiple devices to connect together so you can do things like have the lights turn on when motion is detected. This is really useful and does allow for the sort of scheduling I’d envisioned, but then I came up with a better solution; tying it into my existing HomeKit routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/01/homekit-christmas-tree-with-siri/&quot;&gt;blogged about HomeKit before&lt;/a&gt; and specifically about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge&quot;&gt;Homebridge&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to get non-HomeKit enabled devices to work with the system. Canary is not a HomeKit enabled device and with no open API it wasn’t possible for me to write a plugin. However, Wink does have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-wink&quot;&gt;existing Homebridge plugin&lt;/a&gt; allowing you to control most devices connected to Wink via HomeKit. Unfortunately, HomeKit doesn’t support cameras and so neither does that Wink plugin. Back to the drawing board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of tinkering, I realised I could just re-purpose an existing supported HomeKit protocol; locks. In HomeKit, locks are basic binary operators that are either “secured” or “unsecured”. This works perfectly for my Canary as I could denote it as a doorlock and then have “secured” equal “armed”, and “unsecured” equal “privacy”. After a few minutes, I managed to fork the existing plugin and create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/homebridge-wink&quot;&gt;new version with this hack in place&lt;/a&gt;. Once downloaded, you just need to add the following platform in your Homebridge config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;platform&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;homebridge-wink.Wink&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Wink&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;client_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;quirky_wink_android_app&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;client_secret&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;e749124ad386a5a35c0ab554a4f2c045&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR-WINK-USERNAME-HERE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR-WINK-PASSWORD-HERE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hide_groups&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hide_ids&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sidenote: most of my time tonight was spent trying to find a client_id and client_secret to use for the config. To get these, you usually have to email Wink with response times being around 7-10 days. I decided to rip it out of the Android app instead…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you restart Homebridge, any of your Canary devices in Wink should show up in HomeKit automatically. You can then say something like “Hey Siri, lock the living room” to arm the Canary. I personally like to use HomeKit scenes which allow me to control the Canary automatically with my existing “good morning” and “good night” Siri phrases. I find this much more reliable than a schedule as I already use these phrases every time I go to bed and wake up in order to turn my lights on and off (whereas a schedule might turn the camera on whilst we’re still awake or turn it off before we get up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully in the future we’ll see a public API for Canary and support for cameras in HomeKit so I can make this slightly less hacky but it works for now and means I’ll no longer forget to disable privacy mode at night. If you’re interested in trying this setup yourself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/homebridge-wink&quot;&gt;check out the plugin on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:disarmed&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The use case for this is things like capturing a babies first steps, the sort of thing you could easily miss but can easily find in the 12-hour log of a practically always-on camera. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:disarmed&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:morning&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And I often forget to turn it off when I get up which means my wife and I get a notification of me groggily letting the dogs out every morning. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:morning&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What to expect from the 'Let us loop you in' Apple event</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/21/what-to-expect-from-loop-you-in-apple-event/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/21/what-to-expect-from-loop-you-in-apple-event/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Later today, Apple will be holding a special event entitled ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/&quot;&gt;Let us loop you in&lt;/a&gt;’. I don’t often post my predictions for such events but I’m intrigued by this one as all rumours seem to suggest there is very little to announce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from supply chain rumours and other sources that there will be two hardware releases; an iPhone SE&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:iphonese&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:iphonese&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and an iPad Pro in a 9.7” form factor. Neither of these are terribly exciting nor worthy of a big event as they are things we’ve seen before in sizes we’ve seen before. It will not be easy to talk for 15-20 minutes on each of these devices as it’ll essentially be “this thing we made 6 months ago is now available in a smaller size you are familiar with”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else is there? Apple Watch bands seem to be a certainty with a black milanese loop, some new sports bands, and a NATO-style nylon band&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:excited&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:excited&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As watchOS 2.2 will likely be released today, there will probably be some shiny new watch faces which haven’t been present in the betas over the past couple of months. Speaking of software updates, there is also iOS 9.3 coming today (which was publicised heavily by Apple on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/ios/preview/&quot;&gt;special website&lt;/a&gt;) and a minor update to the Apple TV OS both of which I expect to be showcased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst that could be everything, it seems very lacklustre for an event; everything here could be done by press release which leads me to think there may be more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of, I’m hopeful that there will be a minor Apple Watch hardware revision. There would be no new features or any changes to the design, but the internal S1 chip would be replaced with a faster S2 chip. There is no doubt in my mind that the Apple Watch is being held back by its slow processor and so this would be a good upgrade until a hardware refresh comes before Christmas. I have a couple of reasons for believing this might happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main features of watchOS 2.2 is that you can pair multiple watches to an iPhone. This doesn’t seem like it would be necessary until there are two versions of watch hardware. In my own case, I would likely buy a 2nd generation Apple Watch Sport for everyday use and then use my 1st generation Apple Watch if I was dressing up. Whilst you could argue that some people may have multiple watches already, it seems like odd timing when this multiple watch support could have been earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There haven’t been any leaks from the supply chain but I believe that is because it would just be a case of changing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_S1&quot;&gt;fully integrated chip&lt;/a&gt; inside. There would be no external changes, no massive shipments (like with iPhone), and even the packaging would likely give nothing away as the product name would be the same. I believe Apple could maintain secrecy of a chip change for the Apple Watch in a way that isn’t possible for other hardware updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are hoping for Mac updates, especially to the MacBook, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro, but I do not believe these will make an appearance until WWDC at the earliest. All of them require significant hardware changes which would have leaked through the supply chain, especially as they’d all have exterior changes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:designchanges&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:designchanges&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I’m in the market for a Mac Mini so I’d love to be wrong about this, but I think these updates are a few months away yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves the one thing that Apple are incredibly good at keeping completely secret; software. As nearly all of their software is written in Cupertino, they can keep a very tight lid on it and prevent leaks in a way that is almost impossible with hardware. There have been a few rumours that iTunes may &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; be getting a makeover; whilst I think that is ultimately coming&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:itunes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:itunes&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I think it far more likely that the Apple Music part of iTunes and the Music app on iOS will be getting minor design changes in order to avoid some of the many UX problems that have been evident since its debut last year. This would fit in well with iOS 9.3 which is otherwise fairly light on features&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:93features&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:93features&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for something that is likely to get a lot of stage time. Aside from that obvious issue, I have no idea what software they could be announcing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:software&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:software&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I’m fairly confident there will be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other thing to mention is that I’m fairly confident Tim Cook will mention the current fight with the FBI over encryption at the beginning of the keynote. I also expect numerous mentions to privacy and encryption throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note for those in the UK: Whilst Apple events typically happen at 6pm for us, this event falls within the 2 weeks after the US has moved their clocks back for Daylight Saving Time but the UK hasn’t. This means the event is at 5pm UK time. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/&quot;&gt;watch it on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:iphonese&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Basically an iPhone 6s (minus 3D touch and front-facing flash) in an iPhone 5 size. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:iphonese&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:excited&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is the only thing I can see myself buying from this event at present. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:excited&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:designchanges&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and Mac Pro are all due a design refresh. The MacBook, at just a year old, is unlikely to change much but I imagine they will give in and add a 2nd USB-C port possibly at the expense of the 3.5mm audio jack which is in their crosshairs on the iPhone. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:designchanges&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:itunes&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I mean it has to, right? I know I’ve been saying that every year since the iPhone came out but surely it has to come soon… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:itunes&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:93features&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When your 2nd headline feature is “you can secure your notes with TouchID” then it evidentally isn’t as big a release as it is made out to be. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:93features&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:software&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although an iMessage upgrade and new health apps would be my educated guesses. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:software&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Show Me The Next</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/15/show-me-the-next/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/15/show-me-the-next/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An iOS app I worked on for &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebrowser.com/&quot;&gt;The Browser&lt;/a&gt; has gone live in the App Store today; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/show-me-the-next/id1079373733?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Show Me The Next&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/show-me-the-next.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is very simple; an app with curated articles that you read through at random with a simple swipe. No going back, no list no images, no videos, and no tracking; just fast offline access to interesting articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a quick mockup and then I added some extra features such as the ability to share articles, alter the font size, and change screen brightness&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:clientrequest&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:clientrequest&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I also built a simple CMS so that the articles embedded in the app could be updated remotely. The app is built using Swift 2.1, runs on all devices with iOS 9 or above, and is optimised for all the various shapes and sizes including iPad split screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/smtn-logo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; /&gt;
As well as completely designing the app and the functionality, I was also asked to design the app icon and logo with a simple single sentence brief: &lt;em&gt;“I admire the art of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian&quot;&gt;Mondrian&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;. I took inspiration from the work &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#/media/File:Piet_Mondriaan,_1930_-_Mondrian_Composition_II_in_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow.jpg&quot;&gt;Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and used the same colours and textures with lines to shape the letters SMTN. It was a fun design experiment and something a bit different for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show Me The Next is a free app and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/show-me-the-next/id1079373733?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;available on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:clientrequest&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The client did not ask for these additions but I often like to add extra functionality free of charge when I feel it is of benefit to the app. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:clientrequest&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to announce that v1.3 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Music Tracker&lt;/a&gt; is now available as a free update.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/music-tracker-5c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this version, I’ve focused on speed and stability. The original scanning engine has been completely rewritten from the ground up and now runs faster and for larger libraries than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the app would wake up once an hour and have around 30 seconds in order to scan the library, look for additions, changes, and deletions, and then save all of that information locally. This worked great for small libraries on newer devices like the iPhone 6s but didn’t work so well on an iPhone 5s with a library of over 75000 songs. The reason for this is that iOS limits the amount of time an app can run in the background&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sensible&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sensible&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; if the entirity of the process wasn’t complete in the time allowed, then it would simply fail. This meant that customers with large libraries were typically seeing no updates as the app wasn’t able to get through the entirity of the library within the 30 second window allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I rewrote the scanning engine to be faster but to also work in batches. If iOS terminates the Music Tracker process (as it is taking too long) then the current state is saved and will pick up from where it left off the next time the process is restarted&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:process&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:process&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that huge libraries can now be scanned correctly as they are broken up over a few passes rather than trying to do it all at once. A nice side benefit of this is that the app can now handle older hardware&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hardware&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:hardware&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which previously was too slow to handle even small libraries in a single pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/music-tracker-sync.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
In order to accomodate this new multi-pass scanning engine, I’ve also changed the way in which manual updates are performed within the app. Previously you could “pull to refresh” on the main activity page; this gave you a little spinner icon and not much detail as to what was happening. In v1.3, there is a refresh icon in the top right hand corner that will take you to a new page which details exactly what is going on and shows a progress bar so you can see that it is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already purchased Music Tracker, you should see v1.3 as a free update within the App Store; you can check which version you have installed by going to the settings page within the app. If you don’t yet have Music Tracker, you can get it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;. For more details about the app, you can view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;official website at Dodo Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing: on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dancounsell.com/articles/a-better-format-for-press-kits&quot;&gt;advice of Dan Counsell&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve changed my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/media-kit/&quot;&gt;press media kit&lt;/a&gt; to be a standard HTML page with full access to everything the old zip download contained including details of the app, screenshots, icons, and mockup images. This makes it easier for the many iOS journalists who have switched to using something like the iPad Pro as their main work machine which doesn’t handle zip files particularly well. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/media-kit/&quot;&gt;check out the online media kit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-media-kit.zip&quot;&gt;download the media kit as a zip file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sensible&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a sensible thing; tasks should not be allowed to run for large periods of time in the background otherwise they’ll kill your battery. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sensible&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:process&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Music Tracker typically wakes up every hour to check for changes. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:process&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:hardware&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Previously the app was only available on devices with a 64-bit chip. Music Tracker now runs on any device capable of running iOS 9.0 which means the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, and iPhone 5c are now supported. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:hardware&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Brapp 2.0</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/11/brapp-v2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/11/brapp-v2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months, I’ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brapp.tv&quot;&gt;Brapp&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8&quot;&gt;v2.0 release&lt;/a&gt; which adds a ton of new features for video makers, producers, and music lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-audio.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For video makers, there is a huge improvement to the record and upload flow allowing for studio grade Audio FX such as Pump (compression), EQ, bpm centric Delays, and Reverb&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:anotherdev&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:anotherdev&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with adjustments occuring in real time. You can tap on the camera view to adjust exposure and light balance and the recording quality has been improved. Finally, you can now save videos locally complete with a watermark with your name and the beat creator if applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-beat-trim.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For producers, there is now a systemwide ability to import beats from any app that displays media files. Just tap the share icon and choose the new “Copy to Brapp” option. This will take you to a new editing page that lets you trim the beat to a minute or less in length and add optional fades in or out. The trim page was particularly difficult to build (as you have real time scrubbing and fades, waveform generation, and the ability to move the waveform before you even get to outputting these to a single audio file) but the end result works beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/brapp-profile.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these big features, there are 100s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:literally&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:literally&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of smaller changes including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new profile system makes it possible to hide reposts on a profile so you can just check out their beats and videos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search is more powerful than ever.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is easier to find new people to follow in the new Explore section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can now see trending hashtags as they happen in Search &amp;gt; Videos/Beats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certified. OGs on Brapp will now have the Certified icon by their name&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:certified&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:certified&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is now easier to find beats that are used in videos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is now easier to save beats you like with the new “Save Beat” button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You now get notifications on reposts, so you can see when your followers react to your reposts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out your Mug Shot in Profile &amp;gt; Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can now see all the beats and videos you have Liked in Settings &amp;gt; My Likes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is now easier to Invite friends to Brapp via Facebook or SMS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots of stability and speed improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, previous versions of the app were written in Swift 1.2 using Xcode 6.4 and the iOS 8 SDK. With this build, I migrated it to Swift 2.1 using Xcode 7 and the iOS 9 SDK. This means, among other things, that there is now San Francisco rather than Helvetica Neue throughout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, Brapp has been a really fun project to work on. I can’t say enough good things about the people behind it and I really believe this app is going to be a big deal. If you haven’t checked it out yet, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8&quot;&gt;get Brapp for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. You can also read about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/&quot;&gt;initial build and release&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/11/27/brapp-v1.1/&quot;&gt;v1.1 update last November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:anotherdev&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The audio filters were written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://bangmeansdoit.co.uk/en/&quot;&gt;David Gibson&lt;/a&gt;; I did the integration with the Brapp project and UI. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:anotherdev&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:literally&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Literally. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:literally&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:certified&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am currently certified though I don’t think I will be for long bearing in mind I only have two ‘raps’ and I’m miming in both of them. I did record some sick beats during development but I deleted them pretty quick after recording! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:certified&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Sunday Isn't Special</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/10/sunday-isnt-special/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2016 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/03/10/sunday-isnt-special/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768674&quot;&gt;Government lost a vote&lt;/a&gt; in the House of Commons to change Sunday Trading Laws in the UK. I don’t usually blog about politics&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:politics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:politics&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but Sunday Trading has been a big issue for me and, as a freelancer, I am incredibly disappointed that there will be no change in this ridiculously outdated law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, there are restrictions on trading for shops over 280m². They may only open for 6 consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mostshops&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mostshops&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and there are restrictions on loadings and deliveries. There are some exceptions (such as registered pharmacies, service station outlets, and farms) but pretty much all retail ceases in the UK at 4pm on a Sunday; go to any major supermarket at 3.50pm on a Sunday and you’ll find it packed as people rush to make their purchases before closing time. This is only a fairly recent development though; prior to 1994, the vast majority of shops couldn’t open at all on a Sunday! Thatcher tried to change this in 1986 but was defeated by Labour (protecting workers rights) and her own MPs (concerned with church attendence)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:thatcher&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:thatcher&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his July budget after the 2015 election, George Osborne announced that the Government wanted to devolve control of Sunday Trading restrictions to local councils so they could decide whether shops could remain open for longer. I personally would have preferred a complete abolition of these rules (as happened during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18942729&quot;&gt;run-up to the 2012 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;) but would have been happy with at least some move in the right direction. However, the vote was lost last night with Labour, the SNP, and 27 Conservative MPs voting against the motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this completely unbelievable in the modern age and massively hypocritical on the part of the SNP when Scotland have no restrictions on Sunday Trading&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:snp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:snp&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Opposition gathered around a “Keep Sunday Special” motto but to my mind there is absolutely nothing special about Sunday. In the past, you could argue on religious grounds but that is irrelevant in the UK today when Atheism has overtaken Christianity&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:religion&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:religion&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the number of actual practicing Christians is on a massive decline (just look at Church attendance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the vote yesterday, Mike Cherry, the policy director of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The current system can be seen as a great British compromise which allows families to spend time together, employees to work if they wish to, and provides much needed support for smaller retailers within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely crazy. Families are not spending more time together because of these restrictions and Government should not be restricting free trade on this basis. It also isn’t supporting smaller retailers as large supermarkets have opened small stores on high streets to get around these restrictions. There is already sufficient protections&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:protection&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:protection&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; against working on Sundays for workers which would not have changed with this bill. All this has done is penalise workers who wish to work longer hours on a Sunday and consumers (many of whom may also work on a Sunday) from making their purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a nurse, police officer, retail employee, or even a freelancer; if they finish their shift at 6pm on a Sunday, then they can’t go and do a weekly supermarket shop because the size of the store is deemed too big. I often work on a Sunday and then have to dash off to the local supermarket at 3.30pm when I realise I haven’t got any food for the evening. Whilst there are smaller newsagents or even smaller versions of supermarkets such as Tesco Metro, these often charge higher prices or don’t have the same amount of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of online shopping; it is perfectly acceptable for somebody to make a purchase online at 7pm on a Sunday night but it isn’t legal for a retailer to sell them something from a physical building larger than 280m² outside of specific hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when the economy needs a boost and there are regular complaints about a lack of jobs, it seems to me utterly stupid that there is a law preventing large retailers from creating more jobs. Whilst a separate issue, I’ve never understood why banks aren’t open after around 1pm on a Saturday; there are plenty of people who need work and it seems to me that opening for more hours would solve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I identify as a Conservative, I’m really more of a Libertarian. I believe the Government should have as little to do with people as possible and this is one of those areas where it really shows; a Government should not be able to stop a shop from selling goods at a certain time because of the size of the building it operates from. Scottish politicians should not be able to prevent shops in England from creating more jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday isn’t special. It is no different from any other day, especially if you are a shift worker or a freelancer that works whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time for Sunday Trading restrictions to be totally abolished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:politics&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have a degree in Politics and have a number of strongly-held views but I don’t like to discuss them on my website which is really to advertise my freelance services. I do tweet about politics regularly though at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;@bendodson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:politics&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:mostshops&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most shops tend to open 10am-4pm although some will be 11am-5pm or even midday-6pm. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mostshops&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:thatcher&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I was studying Politics at A-Level, I couldn’t believe that Thatcher’s government had only lost 4 votes in 11 years and one was about the trivial issue of Sunday Trading. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:thatcher&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:snp&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I believe this should have been voted on separately to the Enterprise Bill in order to trigger the ‘English Votes for English Laws’ procedure which would have prevented the SNP from having any say over this. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:snp&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:religion&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/893167/religious-affiliation-british-social-attitudes.pdf&quot;&gt;BSA survery in 2014&lt;/a&gt; showed 49% identified as “no religion” with Christianity coming in at 42%. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:religion&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:protection&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Specifically, staff can “opt out” of working on Sundays even if they had previously agreed in their contract to work on those days. You also can’t be dismissed for not working on a Sunday. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/sunday-working&quot;&gt;Sunday Working&lt;/a&gt; page on the gov.uk website has all of the information. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:protection&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Storefront Additions: A simple way to convert SKCloudServiceController store identifiers into country codes</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/26/storefront-additions-skcloudservicecontroller-to-country-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/&quot;&gt;my article a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, I noted that &lt;code&gt;SKCloudServiceController&lt;/code&gt; would give you a storefront identifier but that there was very little information about how to use that identifier when using the iTunes Search API. As it turns out, Apple do provide a list of store identifiers with their respective ISO country codes on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/linking-to-the-itunes-music-store/&quot;&gt;iTunes Affiliate Links website&lt;/a&gt; - a big thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loretoparisi&quot;&gt;Loreto Parisi&lt;/a&gt; for directing me to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make things a bit easier for other developers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/storefront-assistant&quot;&gt;I’ve put together a simple class and plist file&lt;/a&gt; that will automatically return a country code for the current user’s store. It’s incredibly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StorefrontAssistant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Error: \(error)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Country code: \(countryCode)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storefront Assistant will automatically request permissions to access the Media Library and then fetch the current storefront identifier for the logged in user. If there are any issues (i.e. permissions denied, no connectivity, country code can’t be found) then an NSError will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the country code, you can then use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/&quot;&gt;iTunes Search API&lt;/a&gt; to search for tracks in the correct country; these can then be used with &lt;code&gt;MPMusicPlayerController&lt;/code&gt; for immediate playback or &lt;code&gt;MPMediaLibrary&lt;/code&gt; for saving to the user’s Media Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/storefront-assistant&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10th Mar 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loretoparisi&quot;&gt;Loreto Parisi&lt;/a&gt; has put together some code in order to provide this list as a JSON file instead of a plist; he also has a Node JS implementation to scrape this information regularly from the iTunes Affiliate Link Website. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/loretoparisi/itunes-countrycode-node&quot;&gt;Check it out on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Details on the iOS 9.3 Media Library additions</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/&quot;&gt;article on music library security on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve found myself in the position of being misquoted or misunderstood on sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/02/18/inside-ios-93-apple-will-allow-third-party-apps-to-add-music-to-your-icloud-music-library&quot;&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt; (mainly in the comments) with regards to the new media library APIs in iOS 9.3. This article is intended to clear up some misunderstandings that people have about these new APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In iOS 9.3, there are several additions to the music library. Indeed, it is the first item listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016661-SW1&quot;&gt;What’s New in iOS 9.3&lt;/a&gt; developer document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New methods in the Media Player and StoreKit frameworks let you add an Apple Music track to the music library and play it. First, use the SKCloudServiceController API to determine the current capabilities, such as if the device allows playback of Apple Music catalog tracks and the addition of tracks to the library. Then, you can use the MPMediaLibrary method addItemWithProductID:completionHandler: to add a track to the library and the MPMusicPlayerController method setQueueWithStoreIDs: to play a track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the StoreKit framework has been updated to include an &lt;code&gt;SKCloudServiceController&lt;/code&gt; which basically gives an app the opportunity to request access to a user’s media library and to check if they have the ability to stream Apple Music tracks and / or add those tracks to their iCloud Music library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;code&gt;MPMusicPlayerController&lt;/code&gt; has been updated with a new method named &lt;code&gt;setQueueWithStoreIDs&lt;/code&gt; which allows you to basically hand over an array of Apple Music identifiers and have those play instantly in the Music app without leaving your own app. Interestingly, this allows you to Rickroll someone in just a few lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trackID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;255991760&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// use 302053341 in USA, 255991760 in UK&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;MPMusicPlayerController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setQueueWithStoreIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trackID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This API, whilst interesting, has a few issues; the identifiers for music tracks are different for each country so a US track will not play on a UK Apple Music account&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:storeidentifier&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:storeidentifier&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is also no error handling so it’ll just silently fail if you give it an incorrect identifier or one from the wrong store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final new addition is to &lt;code&gt;MPMediaLibrary&lt;/code&gt; and is a method named &lt;code&gt;addItemWithProductID:completionHandler:&lt;/code&gt;. This allows you to add an Apple Music track to the user’s library as long as they gave permission via the &lt;code&gt;SKCloudServiceController&lt;/code&gt; and they have a valid Apple Music account. I had some issues getting this working on an iPhone 5c but it worked just fine on an iPad Pro leading me to think this may be an API limited to 64-bit devices (although this is still in beta so that may change). However, the API does not allow you to add MP3s to your library or import Spotify tracks or anything like that; it is just a way to add Apple Music tracks to your library. Why is that useful? The scenario I envision is that it is for apps like Shazam that identify music and then traditionally give you a link to go and see it in Apple Music or the iTunes Store. With this new API, those apps can now add a button such as “add this track to your library?” which will allow them to automatically add the Apple Music track to the media library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new APIs do not do any of the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do not allow apps to add music to your library if you are not using Apple Music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do not allow apps to add music to your library that is not available on Apple Music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do not allow apps to delete music from your library&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do not allow apps to edit metadata on any music in your library (i.e. changing title, artist, genre, rating, artwork)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, and linking this back to my previous article, &lt;strong&gt;this new permissions system is only for the new “add Apple Music tracks to your library API”; apps do not require permission to scan through your library&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m still hopeful this will be addressed as at present the ‘Privacy’ settings screen in iOS 9.3 is incredibly misleading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/music-library-privacy.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take serious issue with the phrase &lt;em&gt;“Apps that have requested access to your media library will appear here”&lt;/em&gt; because it makes it sound like apps require permission to access your library which is just not true. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Music Tracker&lt;/a&gt; app continues to work unimpeded on iOS 9.3 with no need to request access and, as demonstrated above, you can start playing streamed music in the Music app without authorization. This is all true as of iOS 9.3 beta 4 so hopefully it may get resolved before the final version of iOS 9.3 is released next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any queries about how these new APIs work or how they will or won’t affect your media library, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;please feel free to contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:storeidentifier&quot;&gt;
      &lt;strike&gt;There is a new API to give you a storefront identifier (mine is &quot;143444,29&quot;) but I&#39;m not sure how you translate to a single language like &quot;gb&quot; for use with the iTunes Search API - if anyone can shed some light on that, please let me know!&lt;/strike&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loretoparisi&quot;&gt;Loreto Parisi&lt;/a&gt; for making me aware of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/linking-to-the-itunes-music-store/&quot;&gt;iTunes Affiliate Link website&lt;/a&gt; which contains a full list of the store identifiers and their respective ISO country codes which can be used with the iTunes Search API. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/26/storefront-additions-skcloudservicecontroller-to-country-code/&quot;&gt;put together a simple class&lt;/a&gt; to take care of this automatically. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:storeidentifier&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Music Tracker v1.1 and Pocket Rocket v1.1 Released</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/16/music-tracker-and-pocket-rocket-1-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/16/music-tracker-and-pocket-rocket-1-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, version 1.1 of both &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Music Tracker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/pocket-rocket/&quot;&gt;Pocket Rocket&lt;/a&gt; were released in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-ipad.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main new feature for Music Tracker v1.1 is native support for iPad. This includes not only the iPad Air and iPad Pro, but also all of the various split-screen modes that can be applied in both portrait and landscape. This release also includes landscape support for the iPhone. There were also a few minor bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m aware that a few people with large libraries (anything over ~25000 tracks) are experiencing some performance issues which can cause the automatic tracking to fail; a new update is under development to fix that. If you have a large library and would like to test that release, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/pocket-rocket-settings.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pocket Rocket v1.1 adds a few features that were requested from existing customers. These include the ability to see the total number of unread articles on the app icon and using Background App Refresh to keep that count up-to-date. There are also a few bug fixes (including a big one that crashed the app with certain query strings in URLs) and a 3D Touch Quick Action (for iPhone 6s) so you can see when the articles were last updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any features you’d like to see added to either Pocket Rocket or Music Tracker, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deleting all NSUserDefaults with Swift</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/05/deleting-all-nsuserdefaults-with-swift/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/05/deleting-all-nsuserdefaults-with-swift/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NSUserDefaults is likely one of the most used APIs on iOS providing a quick and easy way to store basic configuration and settings. However, these can quickly mount up and you’ll typically end up with something like this in your project within a logout method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;standardUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;removeObjectForKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Username&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;removeObjectForKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Token&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;removeObjectForKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SomeSetting&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;removeObjectForKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;FavouriteArtist&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;synchronize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: you should never store secure information like a password or API token in NSUserDefaults; that’s what the Keychain is for. You should probably also use static constants in a config file for your keys but this will do for a demonstration)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with something like this is that you have to remember to go and add an extra &lt;code&gt;removeObjectForKey&lt;/code&gt; whenever you add a new setting and this can be easily forgotten and lead to settings being shared between different user accounts. I’ve definitely been guilty of doing this in the past and, whilst working on an update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/pocket-rocket/&quot;&gt;Pocket Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, I found that this can be much simpler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;standardUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;removePersistentDomainForName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSBundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainBundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundleIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;standardUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;synchronize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will clear all of the NSUserDefaults that have been set by your code leaving you with a fresh slate just as if the app had been deleted and reinstalled. You don’t need to update your logout method whenever a new setting gets added and you can be sure that everything is being reset in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; a few people have asked why I perform &lt;code&gt;NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().synchronize()&lt;/code&gt; as this should happen automatically. The key word here is &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;; since iOS 7, NSUserDefaults do not get written to disk as frequently as previously (i.e. when going into the background). With the addition of things like watch extensions, widgets, and keyboards that can all access a shared NSUserDefaults, I find it is always best to perform a sync (which ensures the data is written to disk immediately) as then none of the other aspects of your app or extensions will access invalid data. It doesn’t add any significant performance overhead in my experience but can save you from embarrassing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calm Radio for iOS</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/02/calm-radio-for-ios/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/02/calm-radio-for-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that the new iOS app I built for &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Calm Radio&lt;/a&gt; is now live in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-ios.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I announced the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/calm-radio-for-apple-tv/&quot;&gt;Apple TV app for Calm Radio&lt;/a&gt;; the client was so pleased with the end result that they commissioned me to also rebuild their existing universal iOS app. This is a special project for me as I didn’t only build the app from scratch, but I also designed it fully. With the Apple TV app, I took design cues from the stock apps provided by Apple such as Movies and TV Shows; with the iOS app, I’ve taken inspiration from that design and kept the vibrant backgrounds created by blurrding the rich artwork that was available for each channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-flow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the standard playback and support for up to 3 ambient channels, the iOS app adds many features not found in the Apple TV app; an alarm clock, sleep timer, ability to skip track, favouriting channels, and full support for streaming to AirPlay and Chromecast devices. I also included support for 3D Touch by making use of Quick Actions to show your most recently listened to stations directly on the app icon. In addition, the app inherits many new features that were first designed for the Apple TV app such as video backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-devices.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m most proud of is the adaptability of the UI. The app can run in an incredible 20 different sizes and orientations&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:orientations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:orientations&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; based on the various iPhone and iPad sizes, portrait and landscape support, and the new split-screen modes available to more recent iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m honoured that my work on the Apple TV app was so well received that I was able to bring the same design and functionality to the Calm Radio iOS app. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download Calm Radio from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://calmradio.com/&quot;&gt;learn more on their website&lt;/a&gt;. The app is free although certain features are limited to paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:orientations&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The full list is iPhone 4s (portrait), iPhone 5 (portrait), iPhone 6 (portrait), iPhone 6 Plus (portrait), iPhone 4s (landscape), iPhone 5 (landscape), iPhone 6 (landscape), iPhone 6 Plus (landscape), iPad Mini (portrait), iPad Mini (landscape), iPad Air (portrait), iPad Air (landscape), iPad Air (30% width split-screen portrait), iPad Air (25% width split-screen landscape), iPad Air (50% width split-screen landscape), iPad Pro (portrait), iPad Pro (landscape), iPad Pro (30% width split-screen portrait), iPad Pro (25% width split-screen landscape), and iPad Pro (50% width split-screen landscape). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:orientations&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Music Tracker</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/20/music-tracker/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/20/music-tracker/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to announce that my latest self-published app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Music Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;available on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-hero.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music Tracker is an iPhone app that keeps an eye on your music library and monitors additions, deletions, and any changes to your songs. With streaming becoming more popular, it is very easy for song metadata to change or for songs to disappear as licensing deals expire; with Music Tracker, you will always know when something in your library changes whether it was by you, a family member, or your streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came up with the idea for Music Tracker after noticing that the amount of songs returned by iTunes was different to that in my Music app on my iPhone. This was due to a song I had in Apple Music that was no longer available in the UK and so had been automatically deleted from my iPhone and greyed out in my iTunes library on my mac. After a quick prototype, I had an app that would run on my phone and keep track of any deletions and additions so I’d be alerted if Apple altered my music. After a few weeks, there were several changes picked up by my app including a few songs that were just plain deleted and some that were completely altered (i.e. I had a studio recording of &lt;em&gt;Uptown Girl&lt;/em&gt; by Billy Joel that was switched for a live recording - with Music Tracker, I could see this change and switch it out for a studio recording from a different album).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my original prototype version, I actually exported the entire music library as a JSON file and uploaded it to GitHub&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:github&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:github&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, to make it work natively on the device without an internet connection I made use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://realm.io&quot;&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt; mobile database which is fantastic and insanely fast. The entire process of extracting the metadata from your library, comparing it against the existing dataset saved in Realm, and then creating a log of changes, additions, and deletions takes around 2.2 seconds on a library of 10000 songs&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mileage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mileage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and allows a full activity feed showing changes on a granular level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-flow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical point of view, there are 3 different ways in which Music Tracker can update depending on the options you choose during setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you enable push notifications, then a silent push notification&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:silent&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:silent&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be sent to your device once an hour that wakes up the app in the background and checks for any changes. This typically lasts around 2 seconds on a standard library of 10000 songs and in my opinion is a pretty clever way of getting around the fact that you can’t schedule background tasks on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t enable push notifications, the app will make use of Background App Refresh (limited to once per hour) to do an update in the background in a similar way to the silent push notifications. These typically fire when the phone is connected to WiFi and a power source but mileage will vary depending on what apps you have installed (and for that reason I recommend the silent push option).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you go into iPhone settings and disable Background App Refresh, then the only way to update the library is to open the app and pull to refresh (or use the 3D Touch Quick Action if you have an iPhone 6s / 6s Plus).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before finishing the app, I added full 3D touch support (both quick actions and “Peek and Pop”) and a basic Apple Watch app that allows you to see how many songs are in your library, and how many songs have been added, changed, or deleted today (along with name and artist of those tracks). In addition, there is a glance providing this information in a single screen and text-based complications for the Utility, Modular, and Mickey Mouse faces with a quick summary of your library today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-watch.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first project in which I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; for the provisioning profile, certificate generation, push notification setup, TestFlight, and iTunes Connect submission and I’d highly recommend it; so much simpler than doing those things manually! The TestFlight beta test was also well worth doing as with something like this I could only really test on a handful of devices but I needed to see load times on other devices and larger libraries - a big thank you to all of my beta testers. Once the app was submitted, I was honestly expecting the app to be rejected but it went straight through review without a problem&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:update&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:update&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing to mention is an issue of privacy. I’m very proud of the fact that no data leaves your device from this app&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:analytics&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I have a simple and transparent &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/privacy/&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:summary&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I do think it is bizarre that iOS does not require any permissions dialogue when accessing the music library. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/&quot;&gt;wrote a post about this last week&lt;/a&gt; detailing this big privacy flaw and I’ve submitted a bug report to Apple (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192&quot;&gt;rdar://24168798&lt;/a&gt;) in the hope that a standard privacy alert will be added in iOS 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-tracker-automatic-tracking/id1062583712?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Music Tracker on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (priced at $0.99 / £0.79) and learn more about it on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Dodo Apps website&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in reviewing Music Tracker or writing an article surrounding the privacy issue, you may can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/dodo/music-tracker-media-kit.zip&quot;&gt;download the media kit&lt;/a&gt; which contains more information along with screenshots, mockups, and app icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find Music Tracker useful, I’m always grateful for a review on the App Store. If you run into any issues or have feature requests, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:github&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can see how this looked by seeing the commit log at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/music-library&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bendodson/music-library&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:github&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:mileage&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary depending on how many songs you have in your library and what device you are using; it’s obviously faster on an iPhone 6s than a 5s. The app requires a 64-bit processor due to this and so will not run on the iPhone 4s, 5, or 5c. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mileage&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:silent&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The key part here is “silent”. These notifications wake up your phone and do some processing but you don’t receive any alerts, sounds, or badge icon updates unless you specifically opt-in to the “Summary Notification” within the settings panel (and that sends a simple text alert once per day if your library changed on the previous day). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:silent&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:update&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although v1.0.1 was “In Review” for 3 days before approval. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:update&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:analytics&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are no analytics or tracking of any kind. I did use &lt;a href=&quot;http://parse.com/&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt; during the beta test in order to save a basic log of library sizes and processing times but that has all been removed for the App Store version and can be checked with a network debugger like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charlesproxy.com&quot;&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:analytics&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:summary&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Summary: I really don’t want your data. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:summary&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Your music library is a security and privacy risk on iOS</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/your-music-library-is-a-security-and-privacy-risk-on-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years Apple has put a lot of effort into making iOS secure and privacy focussed. You are prompted with dialogue boxes whenever an app tries to access your contacts, calendars, photos, or location and you need to confirm that you want to receive notifications. However, whilst developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io/music-tracker/&quot;&gt;Music Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:musictracker&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:musictracker&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I discovered that there is no privacy prompt when a developer tries to access your library. In fact, they can access all of your music data as simply as this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;MPMediaQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;songsQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Title: \(item.title)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just a basic example that’ll output the title of every song in your library but there is a lot of danger in that. This process happens completely silently and in my tests I was able to loop through a library of 10000 songs, put all the metadata in a JSON file&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:json&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:json&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and upload it to a server in under 2 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is this a security or privacy risk? Off the top of my head, I can think of two massive risks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your library says a lot about you&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:bwitched&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:bwitched&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If an advertising company was able to get a complete list of your music library (along with changes to it over time) then they could very easily target you with specific ads. Added a lot of Taylor Swift recently? Here are some ads relevant to that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When iOS first came out there was something called a UDID which basically identified your device uniquely. This was used by marketers to track you across multiple apps and build up a profile. This was stopped by Apple a few years back and replaced with an advertising identifier which you can turn off and which can only be used between apps from the same company (where they are probably already tracking you). However, with a full music library, it would be fairly easy to track someone across multiple apps as periodic snapshots could be compared on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve no idea if apps are already doing this in the background silently but it is something that shouldn’t be able to happen. To that end, I’ve filed a bug report with Apple (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192&quot;&gt;rdar://24168798&lt;/a&gt;) to ask that they implement the same privacy controls that they do for contacts, calendars, photos, and location; a prompt when an app tries to access this data and the ability to grant or reject that permission through the system wide settings. Hopefully this is something Apple will implement in iOS 10 – if you’d like to see this happen, please duplicate bug 24168798 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugreport.apple.com&quot;&gt;Apple Bug Reporter&lt;/a&gt; as that is the best way to bring it to their attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 20th Jan 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; A few people have pointed out that the first beta of iOS 9.3 does have a new privacy setting for “Media Library”. However, this does not stop the above line of code and read-only access to your library; instead, it is part of a new feature that allows for apps to add songs to your iCloud Music Library but requires your permission to do so. Apps that use the MPMediaQuery above won’t even appear in the Media Library permissions page to disable so this is not the solution some think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 23rd Feb 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Several articles are now linking to this and picking up on my comments about iOS 9.3 above and horribly misunderstanding what those new APIs do. I’ve published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/02/23/details-on-ios-9-3-media-library-additions/&quot;&gt;new article detailing exactly what the new APIs in iOS 9.3 add to the music library&lt;/a&gt; (and what they don’t add). As of iOS 9.3 beta 4, there are no privacy controls on scanning your music library and it still works exactly as I’ve described above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Munchkin Report</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/munchkin-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/munchkin-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased to announce that another client app I developed recently has gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Munchkin Report for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-hero.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://munchkinreport.com/&quot;&gt;Munchkin Report&lt;/a&gt; is an online service that helps you track your child’s moments, big and small. From her first steps to yesterday’s nap schedule, Munchkin Report captures memories, keeps parents and caregivers in-sync, and helps you make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real pleasure to work on this app as I was able to work in an incredibly efficient way. The client provided me with a complete API (including full documentation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:apidocumentation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:apidocumentation&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and some static wireframes; I was then left to my own devices for a couple of weeks and given creative freedom to build my own design and tweak the UX as I saw fit. In the end I settled on an iOS 7 style minimal design which puts the important information up front and uses bold colours for UI controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-flow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design is optimised for all four sizes of iPhone from the tiny iPhone 4s to the massive iPhone 6s Plus. It was written in Swift 2.1 and runs on iOS 9.0 and greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/munchkin-report-3d-touch.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just received my iPhone 6s when I started the project so as a little extra&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:extratouch&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:extratouch&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I added 3D touch quick actions so you can quickly get to the log actions from the home screen. There is also “Peek and Pop” integration throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really pleased with the way this app turned out and I think it’ll be a great resource for childcarers and parents. Munchkin Report is free but does require an account from &lt;a href=&quot;https://munchkinreport.com/&quot;&gt;munchkinreport.com&lt;/a&gt; (free trials are available). You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchkin-report-daily-activity/id1062203428?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download Munchkin Report from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://munchkinreport.com/&quot;&gt;learn more on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:apidocumentation&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised how rare that is! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:apidocumentation&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:extratouch&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons I do client work is so I can experiment with new APIs I wouldn’t necessarily use if I was just doing my own apps. I often add features for free to client apps to give me a bit more experience using a certain framework. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:extratouch&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Calm Radio for Apple TV</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/calm-radio-for-apple-tv/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/13/calm-radio-for-apple-tv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased to announce that my first tvOS app for a client has gone live in the Apple TV App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Calm Radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://calmradio.com/&quot;&gt;Calm Radio&lt;/a&gt; is an ubiquitous online radio service with over 150 channels dedicated to specific genres of music and relaxation such as meditation, piano, jazz, latin, and so on. It is free to listen to (with no account) but you can remove ads from the stream and get access to special features with a paid account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Apple TV, I wanted to make the app fit in like a first class citizen of the platform and so I did all of the design and UX work myself with a focus on real time blurs and gradients. As you navigate around the huge array of channels, the background will subtley shift to softer versions of the key colours used in the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you select a channel, you are shown a now playing page that has the title, artist, album, and artwork of the currently playing music. The background is a soft version of the channel artwork but you can choose one of 12 high definition videos to play in the background instead. These videos are looped and blended with the background gradient in order to keep the experience consistent and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-atmospheres.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can choose up to 3 atmospheres (such as wind, rain, waterfalls, crickets, etc) to mix with the currently playing channel and they appear underneath the artwork of the currently playing track. I designed an intuitive and simple UI for this so that listeners could change the volume of each individual atmosphere relative to the channel without using sliders&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sliders&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sliders&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or cluttering the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/calm-radio-top-shelf.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted to use as many tvOS features as possible and so I built in support for the “Top Shelf” allowing you to see and play various channels direct from the TV home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a great project to work on and I’ve learned a huge amount about the Apple TV and the ‘Focus Engine’ that powers it&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:simulator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:simulator&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s been a lot of fun to do my own UX and design work and I think it’s turned out really well; the client was so pleased with it that I’ve been hired to rebuild their existing universal iPhone and iPad app to make it match this design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-radio-online-streaming/id918425515?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download Calm Radio from the Apple TV App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:calmradioapp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:calmradioapp&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://calmradio.com/&quot;&gt;learn more on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sliders&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is no UISlider in tvOS for the simple reason that a slider would be very difficult to navigate away from with the UIFocusEngine. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sliders&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:simulator&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/09/using-the-siri-remote-with-the-apple-tv-simulator/&quot;&gt;handy tip on how to use your Apple TV Siri Remote with the Xcode Simulator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:simulator&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:calmradioapp&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That link will take you to the iOS app as there is no way to link to the tvOS App Store as far as I’m aware. You’ll need to search “calm radio” on your Apple TV App Store to download the app. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:calmradioapp&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Fixing emoji footnote arrow bug in Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/11/fixing-emoji-footnote-arrow-in-jekyll/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/11/fixing-emoji-footnote-arrow-in-jekyll/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; as my static blog generator for a few years now but noticed a minor annoyance a few days ago; whenever I use footnotes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:footnotes&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the return arrow (↩︎) is converted into an emoji (&lt;a href=&quot;http://emojipedia.org/leftwards-arrow-with-hook/️&quot;&gt;↩️&lt;/a&gt;) on iOS and in some RSS readers. Obviously this isn’t desirable and so after a bit of digging I was able to find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this isn’t an issue with Jekyll but with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt; which does the Markdown conversion. Thankfully, there is a config option in kramdown 1.8.0 and above&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:kramdown&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:kramdown&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that lets you specify the text you want to use for the footnote return link and you can set it as unicode to stop it being converted to emoji. Just add the following to your &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kramdown:
  	  footnote_backlink: &quot;&amp;amp;#8617;&amp;amp;#xfe0e;&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regenerate your site and you should find that the emoji arrow is now back to a ↩︎.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:footnotes&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;like this one! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:footnotes&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:kramdown&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You may need to run &lt;code&gt;gem update kramdown&lt;/code&gt; if you installed Jekyll a while ago. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:kramdown&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/08/dodo-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/&quot;&gt;selling WallaBee last year&lt;/a&gt;, I changed my company name to &lt;strong&gt;Dodo Apps Ltd&lt;/strong&gt;. Now that I’m publishing my own apps again (in addition to my freelance work), it seemed time for me to make a few changes to my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve updated bendodson.com so that my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/clients/&quot;&gt;client work&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/apps/&quot;&gt;self-published apps&lt;/a&gt; are now in separate sections&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:photos&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:photos&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have also created a new site at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodoapps.io&quot;&gt;dodoapps.io&lt;/a&gt; to advertise my own apps that are currently available in the App Store&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:musictracker&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:musictracker&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently available for freelance work from February 2016. For more details, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:photos&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My more recent apps also have some nice photos or screenshots to show them off a bit better. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:photos&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:musictracker&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Including a sneak peek of my upcoming “Music Tracker” app… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:musictracker&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swift extension to make CALayer borderColor and shadowColor work with Interface Builder</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/06/swift-extension-calayer-uicolor-interface-builder/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2016/01/06/swift-extension-calayer-uicolor-interface-builder/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Interface Builder in more projects over the past few months due to the benefits of AutoLayout. This has led to me shifting more standard UI code (i.e. colors, borders, shadows, etc) into Interface Builder via the User Defined Runtime Attributes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:udra&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:udra&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, this doesn’t work for the CALayer properties &lt;code&gt;shadowColor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;borderColor&lt;/code&gt; as they expect a CGColor rather than a UIColor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this in a recent project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift&quot;&gt;I created a very basic CALayer extension&lt;/a&gt; (in Swift) that adds UIColor accessors so you can set them via the User Defined Runtime Attributes as so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib.png&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2016/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-example.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/calayer-cgcolor-for-ib-swift&quot;&gt;get the extension on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:udra&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You basically just set &lt;code&gt;layer.cornerRadius&lt;/code&gt; as the key path and use an NSNumber within the User Defined Runtime attributes and then Interface Builder will handle the rest - no more filling your code with &lt;code&gt;button.layer.cornerRadius = 8&lt;/code&gt;, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:udra&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a slight delay in recording, Episode 5 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedivide.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt; is now available. As a New Year treat, this show is a 2 hour special all about Star Wars. We discuss the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, some of our favourite Star Wars video games and comics, and then dive into Episode VII, ‘The Force Awakens’ (there are numerous spoilers but we confined them all to the last half hour or so and there is a big warning before we start). We also discuss one of my favourite oddities in the re-release versions, the addition of CGI rocks to Episode IV:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve received a lot of emails offering me the chance to work on an exciting new project for free in return for some equity. This is an excerpt from one I got yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are currently developing a [redacted] site with some developers who are dragging their heels and would like to to jump ship.  They are more web developers and not used to app coding.  They have been working for free in returning for an equity share in the company.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dismissed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dismissed&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have pitched to a few venture capitalist who like the idea but need to see a minimum viable product out in the market place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is this something you would entertain… work for free now but get a percentage of the company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write back to (nearly) every email I receive so I used my standard “&lt;em&gt;sorry, I don’t ever work on an equity basis &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;as per my website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” reply. However, it’s starting to irritate me just how many of these emails I get per day, the fact they don’t read the clear disclaimer on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;my contact page&lt;/a&gt;, and the mindset that they must have to think that someone is going to work for free for a potential kickback later. Hopefully this post will clear up why I, and most other iPhone developers, will not work for free on your project&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:series&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:series&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short version:&lt;/strong&gt;
We have mouths to feed the same as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long version:&lt;/strong&gt; 
There is a huge amount of paid work available to freelance developers and it pays incredibly well&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:paid&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:paid&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some might say that developers are risk averse and so of course they’d choose paid work over the risky equity venture but that isn’t really true — being a freelancer is already incredibly risky with the fact you have to find work and hope that the client does pay on time and as agreed. That said though, choosing equity over money is one step too far on the risk ladder; the chance of it succeeding is very small and you’ll end up working on it for much longer than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, lets say you’re a developer charging around £500 a day for your services. To get a project to MVP status, you’re likely going to need to work for 1-2 months so you’re looking at around £10-20k of lost revenue. At this point, you need to make back at least that sizeable amount of money in order to break even. However, as the MVP continues, there will be bugs and new features to be added and you’ll be expected to add them for free; after all, you’ve been doing it for so long by now and if the project needs to switch developers then it’ll most likely die and you’ll end up with nothing. You will keep working for free until the project does eventually fail; you might get some small amount back but the real likelihood is that you’ll end up with nothing but a portfolio piece and the realisation that you should have filled the last 6 months with paid work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t hypothetical; whilst I don’t ever work for equity, I’ve worked on a freelance basis on projects who did have other developers working for equity. They were hardly ever available after the project launched (as they needed to work on other projects to put food on the table) and when they were available they did a poor job as they were doing it in their spare time and they’d lost any passion they had for the business. The project folded after 9 months and they got around £1500 for their troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a project does succeed and you do own a portion of the company, it is still going to be a very long time until you see any monetary reward for that. A company only pays it’s shareholders when it is profitable and most startups aggressively use any money they make to grow further; it will likely be years until you get anything. Of course, they might sell to another company and you’ll get a big windfall payment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:divide&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:divide&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but that is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I have with ‘CEOs’ saying “&lt;em&gt;work for free now but get a percentage of the company&lt;/em&gt;” is the hypocrisy of it. They are putting all of the risk of the business on the developers shoulders and bearing very little of it themselves. Most of these people with nothing but an idea are working in a full-time job and continue to do so during the life of the project as they don’t need to do much during development; if it fails, they don’t really lose much whereas a developer loses everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one piece of advice for other freelancers and for people looking to hire them is &lt;strong&gt;“if the project owner isn’t willing to use savings or a loan to pay for a developer, then they are showing that they think the project is too risky”.&lt;/strong&gt; When I built WallaBee, I insisted that all contractors were paid at market rate&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wallabeepaid&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wallabeepaid&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and did so with loans and money from my own freelancing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:lost&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:lost&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you are trying to get an app built and you don’t do the same, you will not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I do not work for equity. It isn’t just the fact that I’ll lose money, it’s that I don’t want to work for a business that treats professionals in this way&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hailo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:hailo&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:dismissed&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By this point I’ve already dismissed the project out of hand even if they are paying; I don’t work on projects started by other developers and I don’t work for people who treat developers who work for free like crap. I can’t ever imagining being this dismissive of people who have given their time for free and are presumably leaving with nothing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:dismissed&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:series&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This should really be considered part 1 of a series entitled &lt;em&gt;‘So you want an iOS developer?’&lt;/em&gt;. Later articles in the series will be &lt;em&gt;‘Why iOS developers won’t sign an NDA’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;‘Why you should pay your invoice when you receive it, not 60 days later’&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:series&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:paid&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I charge near the higher end as my portfolio and experience allows but even at the lower end you’re still talking £300-350 per day! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:paid&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:divide&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As we discussed on this weeks episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/16/the-divide-4-getting-into-code/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Divide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:divide&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:wallabeepaid&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of my freelancers wanted to have equity and I said no. In my opinion, only founders should have equity tied up in a startup as then they are the ones that succeed or fail; contractors should always be paid. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:wallabeepaid&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:lost&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I haven’t made back the money I invested in that business yet but I do have equity in the company that bought it; that is a scenario where equity can be appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:lost&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:hailo&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have form in this belief. Many, many years ago, I was offered the chance to work on a project by a guy who was happy boasting about the millions he made from a previous project. We agreed my freelance rate and when we’d start. He changed the start date and I found other work. He then wanted to move the start date back and was very annoyed when he found out I’d taken other work; he then went on to try and negotiate my day rate down. I walked away at that point as I don’t work for boastful millionaires who look to save £20 a day on an already low freelance rate. That company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hailoapp.com&quot;&gt;Hailo&lt;/a&gt; and became wildly successful. I don’t ever regret not working for them (though I probably should regret not asking them for equity). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:hailo&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Pocket Rocket, read your Pocket articles quickly in Safari on iOS</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/20/pocket-rocket/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2015 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/20/pocket-rocket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/&quot;&gt;I sold WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been splitting my time between client work&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:clients&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:clients&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my Xbox One, and doing small apps that help improve my life in little ways. Today, Apple finally approved&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:appstore&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:appstore&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; my first self-published app in a long time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Pocket Rocket&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/pocket-rocket.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I save most articles that I want to read at a later date with &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; but I hate their mobile apps. Tapping an article will load their own reader view&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:broken&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:broken&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it’s an extra step to jump to Safari. In addition, their apps aren’t updated for split screen support or new device sizes and so the experience is pretty poor. With Pocket Rocket, I wanted to do one thing; have my Pocket queue load up and then when you tap on an article it should load in Safari. I prefer using Safari as then you get to see the article as intended and with content blockers most pages load quickly. I got the basic version working within in an hour and it worked well enough for my needs; then, when I got the iPad Pro, I realised this could be a useful app for other people as it dramatically improves the reading experience especially when used in split screen mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pocket Rocket is completely free with no ads or tracking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:noads&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:noads&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It runs on any device capable of running iOS 9 and is a fully adaptive so it looks great no matter what screen-size you have. Due to this adaptability, it works in all split-screen modes on applicable iPads and that is the way I tend to use it. You can swipe on an article to archive or delete it upon reading. There is also a settings panel so you can choose whether links open in Safari or via an in-app browser (with the option to enable a reader view&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:reader&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:reader&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on launch if you want).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-rocket-quickly-read/id1062699303?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;get Pocket Rocket for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:clients&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of which I’ve done a lot; recently launched apps include &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/&quot;&gt;Brapp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/11/19/chippd-app-for-sharing-personal-messages/&quot;&gt;Chipp’d&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/17/natural-cycles-apple-watch-app/&quot;&gt;Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; with two more apps awaiting approval from Apple… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:clients&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:appstore&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I won’t go into details as Apple specifically request people don’t, but it has been one of the longest and most painful App Store review processes to date. I don’t know if they’ve been having a bad month but a number of my projects have had a rough ride through the review process for no good reason lately. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:appstore&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:broken&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I hate their reader view as it often misses text or puts pull quotes in the wrong places. In addition, the scrolling was completely broken on the iPhone 6S for a few weeks. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:broken&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:noads&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Literally nothing leaves your device apart from when you log in with Pocket (and that is a secure connection with Pocket’s servers via OAuth so I see nothing); I don’t want to know anything about you and respect your privacy. This also isn’t a money-making exercise so the whole thing is free with no In-App Purchases. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:noads&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:reader&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reader view is only available in the in-app browser, powered by SFSafariViewController, as there is no URL scheme for opening Safari with reader view enabled. I’ve submitted a Radar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5024178285576192&quot;&gt;rdar://23684808&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:reader&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Natural Cycles Apple Watch app</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/17/natural-cycles-apple-watch-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2015 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/17/natural-cycles-apple-watch-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very proud to announce that my first Apple Watch app for a client has gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturalcycles/id765535549?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/&quot;&gt;Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; is a popular iPhone and Android app that allows you to track your fertility or plan a pregnancy. It can tell you when you are fertile, when you are ovulating, when your next period is due, when you are pregnant, and the progress of your pregnancy. I was hired as a freelance Swift developer to build an Apple Watch app that would be bundled in with their big v2.0 update and would allow viewing and logging of this critical information. The app allows you to see your current fertility level, body temperature, and progress of your period as well as viewing messages from Natural Cycles. In addition, you can quickly update your current body temperature and menstrual flow within the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-log.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the core Apple Watch app, I also added support for Notifications and Glances making for an even quicker way to view your information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-glance.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite feature, however, is the addition of full text Complications so you can see your current body temperature and fertility status on your watch face:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fertility&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fertility&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/nc-complication.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was quite difficult (but rewarding!) for a few reasons. Firstly, the design was very ambitious when watchOS severely limits the amount of customisation that can be performed. Secondly, the iOS app was a Cordova app&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:cordova&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:cordova&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rather than a native app which meant I had to write a JavaScript plugin and set up some build scripts in order for the native Swift watchOS code to be able to speak with the iPhone. There was also a requirement to make the app as easy as possible to update (i.e. updating the iOS app shouldn’t break the watchOS app) and so I built everything such that the phone takes care of all logic and a lot of the UI so the watch app can be altered without going through the App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really exciting project to work on and I’m very happy with the end results. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naturalcycles/id765535549?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download Natural Cycles from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/&quot;&gt;learn more on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fertility&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This did lead to an awkward situation when I’d left the complication enabled on my Mickey Mouse face that I use at weekends; the weekend after testing was complete, I switched to my Mickey Mouse face to be greeted with the words “Not Fertile” underneath his tapping foot! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fertility&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:cordova&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t usually work on non-native apps but I was willing to make an exception as the bulk of code I’d write would be fully native (as there is no way to write non-native apps on the Apple Watch due to the lack of a UIWebView) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:cordova&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedivide.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt;, a podcast I co-host, has just gone live. This week, we discuss the routes we all took to becoming software developers. We take a look at how the programmer market is evolving while sharing our experiences of how we learned to code and we close with some musings and tips on where new coders might start to learn how to join the digital gold rush. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Lord_Chancellor&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; also shares a harrowing tale of how Captain Janeway wouldn’t look at him…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been re-watching Star Wars&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:machete&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:machete&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this weekend in preparation for &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; and a special episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/02/introducing-the-divide/&quot;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt; we are recording after Christmas. When it got to the Death Star briefing sequence towards the end of &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;, I was reminded of an excellent video that came out after the original iPad announcement with a mashup of that sequence and Steve Jobs voiceover. I had a quick look for it and couldn’t find it as for some reason it had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbHF63b7g50&quot;&gt;removed from YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:legal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:legal&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After much searching, I eventually found a copy online but I’ve extracted it and saved it here to avoid it disappearing again in the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/star-wars-ipad.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  (It looks like your browser doesn&#39;t suppoer HTML5 video)
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love this video and wish I knew who created it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:machete&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/04/the-correct-way-to-watch-star-wars/&quot;&gt;Machete Order&lt;/a&gt;, obviously (although I’m tempted to re-watch &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/em&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/comments/3qvj6w&quot;&gt;this theory&lt;/a&gt; that Jar-Jar is a Sith master…) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:machete&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:legal&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t look like a takedown notice so maybe the account was deleted for some other video and this disappeared along with it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:legal&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Using the Siri Remote with the Apple TV Simulator</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/09/using-the-siri-remote-with-the-apple-tv-simulator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a tvOS app for a client recently which has led to a lot of time spent building to both the Apple TV hardware and simulator. Whilst the simulator is very good for basic testing, the simulated remote can be a bit tricky to use and so I was very pleased to discover today that the physical Siri Remote can be used with the Apple TV Simulator on El Capitan. All you have to do is pair your Siri Remote to your Mac and it’ll work in the simulator just like it does with the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full set of steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unpair your remote from your existing Apple TV (if applicable) by holding down the menu button and volume up button for around 5-10 seconds whilst the Apple TV is unplugged or otherwise out of Bluetooth range&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:pairing&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:pairing&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open up the Bluetooth settings panel in OS X; you should see a device with no details other than a mac address. Pair it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Profit! Your Siri Remote is now paired and can be used in the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 1080p external monitor plugged into my iMac 5k and so if I run the Apple TV simulator on that in fullscreen mode it feels almost exactly like using the real hardware. This could be a good stop gap for those on a budget as you could just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLLC2ZM/A/siri-remote&quot;&gt;buy a Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; for testing rather than the whole Apple TV&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:budget&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:budget&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You should always test your apps on real hardware of course but this is a useful trick nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:pairing&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Otherwise it’ll just unpair and repair very quickly - a frustrating way to spend 15 minutes on a Wednesday morning! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:pairing&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:budget&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Or for developers who simply don’t want a second Apple TV. I’ve been moving mine between my office and living room for the past week and considered getting a second “development only” Apple TV to avoid this minor irritation; buying just a second remote seems a wiser investment. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:budget&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/02/introducing-the-divide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-divide/id1063410638&quot;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt;, a new podcast I’ve been working on recently, is now available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-divide/id1063410638&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/the-divide.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks, myself, &lt;a href=&quot;http://misterford.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mr Christopher Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnwordsworth.com/&quot;&gt;Dr John Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt; will discuss a particular topic that is of interest to us for around an hour. The topics of our first three shows (which are available now) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1, The Phantom Keeper&lt;/strong&gt;: A round-table discussion of our favourite PC games with each of us allowed to bring two for consideration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Geeks and a Toddler&lt;/strong&gt;: A debate about our current computer setup and whether we can see a tablet replacing our laptops&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitting in with all of the stereotypes&lt;/strong&gt;: We discuss media in the digital age including films, tv, music, magazines, books, and comics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-divide/id1063410638&quot;&gt;subscribe on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/itunes1063410638/the-divide&quot;&gt;listed online with Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, or by directing your podcast app of choice&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:overcast&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:overcast&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedivide.co.uk/shows/itunes.xml&quot;&gt;our XML Feed&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can download the MP3 files directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedivide.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The Divide website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These first few episodes, whilst not perfect&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:perfect&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:perfect&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, have been a lot of fun to record and hopefully you’ll enjoy them. If you have feedback, questions, or want to suggest a topic, you can chat to us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PodcastDivide&quot;&gt;Twitter via @PodcastDivide&lt;/a&gt;. Our next episode should go live on Wednesday 16th December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:overcast&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I personally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:overcast&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:perfect&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are a few minor mic issues which we’ve fixed now and our second episode has an unscheduled drop-in from a hungry toddler. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:perfect&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>HomeKit enabled Christmas tree lights with Siri control</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/01/homekit-christmas-tree-with-siri/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/01/homekit-christmas-tree-with-siri/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year we seem to buy a bigger Christmas tree. This year is no exception and it is now proving difficult to maneuver around it to turn the lights on and off. To fix this, I’ve connected my lights up to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belkin.com/uk/F7C027/p/P-F7C027/&quot;&gt;Belkin WeMo&lt;/a&gt; and I’m running the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge&quot;&gt;Homebridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:luke&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:luke&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; server so that I can control it all via Siri:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBuMQ-PMyeY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this up and running on your own machine, you’ll need to do the following in the Mac Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ruby -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
brew install node
sudo npm install -g homebridge
sudo npm install -g homebridge-wemo
homebridge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install brew, install node, install Homebridge, install the WeMo plugin for Homebridge, and then attempt to run Homebridge (which will fail as you have no config file). Next, you’ll want to go to &lt;code&gt;~/.homebridge&lt;/code&gt; and create a config.json file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Homebridge&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;port&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;51826&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pin&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;031-45-154&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This is an example configuration file with all supported devices. You can use this as a template for creating your own configuration file containing devices you actually own.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;accessories&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;accessory&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;WeMo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Christmas Tree&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This shim supports Belkin WeMo devices on the same network as this server. You can create duplicate entries for this device and change the &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; attribute to reflect what device is plugged into the WeMo, for instance &amp;#39;Air Conditioner&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Coffee Maker&amp;#39;. This name will be used by Siri. Make sure to update the &amp;#39;wemo_name&amp;#39; attribute with the EXACT name of the device in the WeMo app itself. This can be the same value as &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; but it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;wemo_name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Christmas Tree&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part is to make sure that the &lt;code&gt;wemo_name&lt;/code&gt; matches the name of your device within the WeMo app; the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute is what you want your device to be called on HomeKit. Run the &lt;code&gt;homebridge&lt;/code&gt; command again and you should see that your device is found and Homebridge is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ll need to get a HomeKit enabled app to run all of this. My recommendation is to use the one that Apple provides to developers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/HomeKitCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html&quot;&gt;HomeKit Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, although that will require you to know how to sideload apps from Xcode. Alternatively you can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/elgato-eve/id917695792&quot;&gt;Elgato Eve app&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have an app, you’ll need to add the Homebridge using the pin that is in your config file. You can play around with the app and create rooms, scenes, zones, etc, but for now the basic commands should work. If you can turn your device on and off via the HomeKit enabled app, you will be able to activate Siri and say “&lt;em&gt;turn on the Christmas tree&lt;/em&gt;”, “&lt;em&gt;turn off the Christmas tree&lt;/em&gt;”, and “&lt;em&gt;is the Christmas tree on?&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added bonus: if you have an Apple TV, you are signed into iCloud, and you use iCloud keychain, then you’ll be able to use all of these voice commands when you’re outside of your house! It’s a pretty useful way to activate these devices and I have several of them dotted around my home&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:straighteners&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:straighteners&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Homebridge also supports many other services such as Philips Hue (without the need for their HomeKit bridge) and you can write your own plugins very easily&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:prismatik&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:prismatik&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next task is to dig out some code I wrote last year to turn the tree lights on and off automatically depending on if I’m in the house using an iBeacon…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:luke&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lukeredpath.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Luke Redpath&lt;/a&gt; for introducing me to Homebridge. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:luke&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:straighteners&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After my wife asked me for the 62nd time if she’d left her straighteners plugged in whilst we were driving in the car, I set up the plug near her dresser with a WeMo so she can use Siri to ask “&lt;em&gt;are my straighteners turned on?&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;turn off the straighteners&lt;/em&gt;” if need be! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:straighteners&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:prismatik&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/homebridge-prismatik&quot;&gt;very basic plugin&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lightpack.tv/&quot;&gt;Prismatik Light Pack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:prismatik&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big update I worked on for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brapp.tv&quot;&gt;Brapp&lt;/a&gt; went live today on the App Store. It’s the first major update for the app and adds the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can now adjust audio levels of yourself and the beat after recording. Sweet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can now rotate videos after recording so you’re not sideways when you don’t want to be.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We’ve added 5 new video filters! Ice, Whitewash, Planet Rock, Purple Haze and Blackout.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We’ve added controls for brightness and video filter intensity so there are infinite variations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The new video player is faster, smoother, lighter to control and does not overlay on top of videos.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Producer’s names now show on videos made on their beats.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The new beat player shows real waveforms because real waveforms rule.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can now loop beats by pressing the ∞ button.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Spins now show on beats! Spins are all the plays of a beat INCLUDING plays of videos made on them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can now filter your Saved Beats by title, producer name, #hashtag and bpm.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can now edit info on your beats &amp;amp; videos. Phew.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When you make a video you can see it’s progress as it uploads, you no longer have to wait hopingly!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When you tap the beat icon on any video it shows you the beat, now it also shows you all the other - videos made on that beat on the same page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When commenting on a beat/video it won’t stop playing what you are listening to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can tap profile pictures to make them big.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is now easier to find your Facebook and Twitter friends, and connect with popular users on Brapp.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And there’s a heap of other handsome UI, UX and stability updates. P.s. We’re just getting started!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t checked it out yet, you can get Brapp for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8&quot;&gt;the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/&quot;&gt;read about the initial build and release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chipp'd, an app for sharing personal messages</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/11/19/chippd-app-for-sharing-personal-messages/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that an iPhone app I’ve been working on since September this year has gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chippd/id570739404?mt=8&quot;&gt;Chipp’d v2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipp’d is an app that works with real world products (available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;) to let you share secrets or private messages with your friends. You simply scan the QR code on the sticker, create your secret (with video, audio, photos, and text), and send the sticker or card; your friend will then be able to see that secret when they scan it with the app or any other QR scanner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/chippd-code.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to share secrets for free using the app via auto-generated URLs that can be sent via email or SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the CTO of Chipp’d to integrate their existing API into the product on an incredibly agressive timescale&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:timescale&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:timescale&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Everything was written in Swift 2.0 and used AutoLayout for flexible layouts on all iPhone screen sizes. I’m particularly proud of the QR scanner which I custom built when it transpired that the products that had been printed and shipped to distributors were too light for a conventional QR scanner to detect; I used GPUImage to manipulate the live video feed with multiple filters per second in order to quickly scan at different brightnesses and solve the issue before it caused major problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chippd/id570739404?mt=8&quot;&gt;Chipp’d on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (it’s free) and you can purchase the stickers and cards to use with it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlewis.com/search?Ntt=chipp%27d&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:timescale&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The stickers and cards were printed, sitting in a warehouse, and about to be available for sale from John Lewis for Christmas 2015! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:timescale&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A simple Audio Recorder controller in Swift (for iPhone)</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/10/20/a-simple-audio-recorder-controller-in-swift-for-iphone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;iOS provides a number of useful modal views within it’s system frameworks with everything from sending email to taking photos or video. However, there is still not a standard way to perform what is a fairly basic task; recording a voice memo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a need for such a feature on a project recently and so I put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/AudioRecorderViewController-Swift&quot;&gt;AudioRecorderViewController&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a basic modal view controller that allows you to record, playback, re-record, and save audio locally in mp4 format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/audiorecorderviewcontroller.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage is insanely simple and modelled on such classes as &lt;code&gt;UIImagePickerController&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IBAction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;presentAudioRecorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AnyObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AudioRecorderViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;audioRecorderDelegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;presentViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;completion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;audioRecorderViewControllerDismissed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;withFileURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;fileURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something with fileURL&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dismissViewControllerAnimated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;completion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a href=&quot;/weblog/2015/10/05/healthkit-radar-22977320/&quot;&gt;my post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; about the broken implementation of the &lt;code&gt;HKHealthStore&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;deleteObjectsOfType:predicate:withCompletion:&lt;/code&gt;, I’ve put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bendodson/c0f0a6a1f601dc4573ba&quot;&gt;a gist&lt;/a&gt; which provides a fixed method that works with &lt;code&gt;HKSampleType&lt;/code&gt; objects; &lt;code&gt;deleteSamplesOfType:predicate:withCompletion:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HealthKit&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;completion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;executeQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It simply uses the &lt;code&gt;NSPredicate&lt;/code&gt; within a &lt;code&gt;HKSampleQuery&lt;/code&gt; in order to find any objects that match the &lt;code&gt;HKSampleType&lt;/code&gt; and then deletes them with the &lt;code&gt;HKHealthStore&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;deleteObjects:withCompletion:&lt;/code&gt; - this correctly ensures that you are only deleting objects that match both the predicate and type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of example, this simply extends &lt;code&gt;HKHealthStore&lt;/code&gt; so you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicateForSamplesWithStartDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beginningOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;endDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stepType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuantityType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quantityTypeForIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;healthStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deleteSamplesOfType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stepType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;withCompletion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you can file a duplicate of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5021999797633024&quot;&gt;rdar://22977320&lt;/a&gt;) if you’d like to see the original bug fixed but in the meantime the above should allow you to carry on with your HealthKit app without worrying about deleting other data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with any code, it is inevitable that you’ll stumble across bugs. When this happens with iOS development, Apple ask developers to submit a “radar” so that they can track and hopefully fix any issues that arise. The issue is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugreport.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple Bug Reporter&lt;/a&gt; is locked down and non-searchable so you have no idea if anyone else has submitted the same issue. Apple supposedly collate all of the bugs and mark any issues as duplicates and then use the number submitted to gauge how important an issue is and prioritise it’s fix. This has led to sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;Open Radar&lt;/a&gt; that let developers copy and paste their bug reports so other developers can search and then simply submit new bugs as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, today I found an interesting bug in HealthKit. iOS 9 added a new method named &lt;code&gt;deleteObjectsOfType:predicate:withCompletion&lt;/code&gt; which is supposed to let you delete any objects you have written to HealthKit nice and easily. For example, I might have an app which constantly checks your step count and flights climbed throughout the day and so it will want to delete any steps and flights from 00.00 to 23.59 before it adds the updated count. Unfortunately, the method doesn’t seem to respect the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parameter and so it will delete everything that matches your query regardless of what &lt;code&gt;HKObjectType&lt;/code&gt; it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicateForSamplesWithStartDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beginningOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;endDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stepType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuantityType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quantityTypeForIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;healthStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deleteObjectsOfType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stepType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;withCompletion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;healthStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;saveObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flightsSample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected result is that you’ll end up with an entry for Step Count (9800 steps) and an entry for Flights Climbed (15). However, you’ll only get the Flights Climbed entry as the line &lt;code&gt;healthStore.deleteObjectsOfType(flightsType, predicate: predicate, withCompletion:...&lt;/code&gt; will delete all entries that match the predicate, regardless of the &lt;code&gt;HKObjectType&lt;/code&gt;. In addition, if you look at the headers for this method within the HealthKit framework, they don’t add up with what is expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/radar-22977320.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that this method was refactored at some point prior to release and has this rather serious bug. I’ve filed this as a radar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5021999797633024&quot;&gt;rdar://22977320&lt;/a&gt;) but in the mean time you’ll need to do a manual search for objects with &lt;code&gt;HKSampleQuery&lt;/code&gt; and delete them with a separate call if you want to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve put together a fix for this issue with a new &lt;code&gt;HKHealthStore&lt;/code&gt; method, &lt;a href=&quot;/weblog/2015/10/06/hkhealthstore-extension-deletesamplesoftype/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;deleteSamplesOfType:predicate:withCompletion:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Whilst iOS 9.1 hasn’t fixed this issue, my bug report has today (23rd Oct 2015) been marked as a duplicate of issue 23097982 so looks like they may be getting around to fixing it. iOS 9.2 perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/the-times-they-are-a-changin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over three and a half years ago I &lt;a href=&quot;/weblog/2012/02/16/ive-been-looking-forward-to-this-day-for-a-long-time/&quot;&gt;announced the launch of WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, “the ultimate collectibles game for iOS”. Whilst it has been a labour of love for me for over the past four years, it has also been incredibly stressful and draining at times. Today I was very happy to announce that I’d &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/blog/sep-2015/wallazee&quot;&gt;sold WallaBee to Munzee&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t go into the details of how that will work for players (you can find out all about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/blog/&quot;&gt;WallaBee Blog&lt;/a&gt;) but I did want to talk a bit about how a relatively simple game became a huge business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created WallaBee as it was a game I wanted to play&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wanttoplay&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wanttoplay&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I’d built several iOS apps in the past (including several that were featured by Apple) and my day job previously had been as a PHP developer so it was fairly trivial for me to throw the basic building blocks together. Over a few months of testing and iteration the game went live; it was free but monetised by using In-App Purchases for in game currency as well as a pro subscription for $5 a month which gave additional benefits to players. The feedback was great and I iterated quickly to a v1.1 product which launched at Nonick 012 where WallaBee was voted the ‘Best European Gaming Startup of 2012’. Over the coming years I’d add extra bits of complexity and hidden secrets&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:skip&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:skip&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and generally expand things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my big plan was to launch a version 2 product. I’d always considered v1.* to be a proof of concept and I had a ton of ideas for things I wanted to improve on. I pitched the idea to my co-founders in November 2012 and we showed off some screens and concepts to our players on April 1st 2013&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:aprilfool&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:aprilfool&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was around that time that the number of players was expanding rapidly and so I spent most of my time dealing with server issues and scalability. Over time, the fast iteration I’d started with slowed to a halt as I dealt with server scaling and that lead to issues when the innovation of iOS overtook us; for example, we didn’t implement AutoLayout and so weren’t equipped to deal with things like the iPhone 6 resolution change. This eventually led to nearly every issue needing the same solution; a complete rewrite of both the app and API. Unfortunately this was difficult to manage as all of my time as the sole developer was being taken up either trying to hold the server issues together enough for another release or dealing with player issues that crop up when you have thousands of people able to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, it just wasn’t fun for me anymore so I made the decision that I would &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/blog/aug-2015/the-end&quot;&gt;shut it down&lt;/a&gt;. A few minutes after that announcement, Rob Vardeman from Munzee got in touch and asked if we could speak. I’d met him before when he was in London for a Munzee event and after a discussion, some emails, and a lot of thinking, I decided to let Munzee acquire the company so that they could continue to grow it in the way I had wanted to. I am confident that they will do an excellent job at maintaining the quirky side of WallaBee&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:cats&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:cats&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whilst also being able to add some amazing new features; I’m so sure of it that I have remained as a shareholder of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my experiences, I have a few pieces of wisdom to share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s fine to get something launched but don’t forget to put in the groundwork for scalability. If you don’t know what you’re doing, find someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monetise your game from the start. We never had any issues but I see startups every day that get a big of investment and think that if they build it they can monetise it later; don’t do that. We launched with 30-day and 90-day subscriptions and most players bought a 90-day one straight off. It is much easier to alter your existing payment structure (as we did when we went from subscriptions to single payments for goods) than to try and add one when everything was free previously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never announce something before it is built. This is a lesson that few people have mastered as it is insanely difficult trying to keep something awesome from the people who are going to love it most; it is also easy to announce something as then you feel like it forces you to launch it by that date but it doesn’t work. Take a leaf out of Apple’s book and only announce something when it is done and going to ship within the next 2 weeks (and when it comes to software, announcing something that is available “Today” should be the rule).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate how difficult it is to manage a community of players or how crucial it is that you do. I frequently had to deal with issues such as bullying, stalking, and just generally petty squabbles. We had births, deaths, celebrations, and everything in between&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:death&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:death&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There was also the inevitable bugs and server issues that required an apology. However, because of the way we handled those issues publicly and fairly, it cut us a lot of slack when things went wrong. A good community is the key thing for any social app and must be nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what now? Without WallaBee to manage over the past few weeks, I’ve found myself at a bit of a loose end with so much more free time! I’ve written three apps so far including a content blocker, an app based on HealthKit, and an app to let me fly my Bebop Drone with an iOS MFI controller&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:stevethree&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:stevethree&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; all of them will be available on the App Store at some point. I’m also collaborating on an Apple TV game with another developer which will hopefully be live in November. Beyond that I haven’t decided what the future has in store but I’m enjoying working on small, offline apps for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing to mention is a slight change to the way I do my freelance work. Due to WallaBee becoming my main business for a while, I changed my company name from Ben Dodson Apps Ltd to WallaBee Ltd. As Munzee are based in the US, they have no need for a UK Limited company and so they have simply purchased the rights and assets of the WallaBee app and brand. I’ve therefore changed the company name to Dodo Apps Ltd&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dodo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dodo&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and that is what I’ll be using for all of my freelance business from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:wanttoplay&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And the nice thing now is that I get to play it and enjoy it! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:wanttoplay&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:skip&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of our players, ‘SkipOkane’ put together &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipslists.wikidot.com/stuff-to-try&quot;&gt;a list of some of the secrets&lt;/a&gt;. My favourite is probably the ‘Mirage’ item which would always appear as a #1 when you purchased it (although the ‘Boomerang’ item that comes back if you try and recycle it is a close second as is the jousting minigame…) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:skip&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:aprilfool&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My reasoning was that if they hated it, we could pretend it was a joke. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:aprilfool&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:cats&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They’ve done well so far; the first set they created is made entirely of dancing cats. I think it’s in safe hands! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:cats&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:death&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I would never have believed that somebody would want to speak with me in the final weeks leading up to their death as they wanted to make arrangements for how their game items could be distributed. It’s humbling and hard to deal with. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:death&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:stevethree&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I would love to do a Steve Jobs “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZYlhShD2oQ&amp;amp;t=2m19s&quot;&gt;these are not 3 separate devices&lt;/a&gt;” but they are. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:stevethree&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:dodo&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I first used the name “Dodo Apps” when I was doing my A-Level IT course. I built a choral robe management system in Microsoft Access and had to choose a name for the about page; I chose “Dodo Apps” as I was a big fan of the dodo from Alice in Wonderland and because it used letters from my surname. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:dodo&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/25/brapp-the-rap-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that an iPhone app I’ve been working on since March this year has gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8&quot;&gt;Brapp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/brapp.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brapp is a free and easy way to create and discover exciting musical collaborations all over the world. Producers can share their beats allowing anyone to make mini music videos right on their phone. When you choose a beat and hit record, the camera starts rolling and the custom studio technology balances your audio (be it singing, rapping, or playing an instrument) onto the beat ready for you to add video filters and share with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the sole iOS developer on the project and worked closely with the app creator&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:greatguys&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:greatguys&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and his API developer to bring it all to life. I was able to write the app in Swift and use AutoLayout to make sure everything scales beautifully on all 4 sizes of iPhone from the 3.5” iPhone 4S upto the 5.5” iPhone 6S Plus. In addition, I made use of GPUImage for the custom video filters and a whole load of low-level audio APIs to get the audio balance just right as well as real time waveforms and switching between external microphones. The design went through a number of iterations, each better than the last, and I was able to use my extensive UX knowledge to help shape the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a great project to work on with a load of interesting technologies plus I got to lay down some sick beats&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sickbeats&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sickbeats&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brapp-rap-sing-or-dance-to/id1022327727?mt=8&quot;&gt;Brapp on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (it’s free) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brapp.tv&quot;&gt;learn more on the official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;These were great guys to work with. During a Slack conversation, they made the mistake of saying “Yes @bendodson, that is right” to which I said “I want that on a t-shirt”. A couple weeks later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/thatisright.jpg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the post… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:greatguys&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AppIndex Interview</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/23/appindex-interview/</link>

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/09/23/appindex-interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I was interviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://appindex.com/&quot;&gt;AppIndex&lt;/a&gt; about my work as a freelance app developer. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://appindex.com/blog/ben-dodson-ios-dev-talks-app-development/&quot;&gt;read the full article on their website&lt;/a&gt; but I’ve also put their questions and my answers below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-involved-in-developing-apps-for&quot;&gt;How long have you been involved in developing apps for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I started developing apps professionally in August 2009, shortly after iOS 3.0 was released, but I tinkered around with the iOS SDK when it was first announced the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-types-of-apps-do-you-work-on&quot;&gt;What types of apps do you work on?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have quite a varied portfolio but for a long time the apps I worked on were location based (i.e. travel guides, restaurant finders, interesting places nearby, etc). Nowadays I tend to work on a lot of social network type apps but that’s probably more indicative of what clients are looking for at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-platforms-tools-and-languages-do-you-work-with&quot;&gt;What platforms, tools and languages do you work with?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the mobile side I only deal with iOS and all my new projects are written in Xcode using Swift 2.0 (with only a couple of legacy apps written in Objective-C). However, I also do backend development for APIs which I write exclusively in PHP. All my work is done on OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-apps-have-you-worked-on-that-you-are-most-proud-of&quot;&gt;What apps have you worked on that you are most proud of?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the app I was most proud of with was the “Horse Tracker” for the Grand National horse race. I worked with a company that attached trackers to the horses so we could see in realtime where they were on the field and display that to the user. It was really nice to use, especially on the iPad which had a full map view of the racecourse (which was never released in the end) and used lots of really cool technology such as audio indexing to perfectly match the time of the race on your TV screen to the data coming from the trackers, even if you were watching on a delayed stream or via a catch-up service hours later. Of course, nothing makes me more proud than the apps I write and publish myself so they will always beat client projects but that one was special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-big-trends-you-see-in-app-development-right-now&quot;&gt;What are the big trends you see in app development right now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m starting to see a lot more thoughtful design coming through at the moment. Previously everybody was still trying to work out how to get data onto a small screen and most designers I worked with via clients had experience in print or web which didn’t always translate across; nowadays the level of design work seems to be much improved and everybody wants a slicker experience with more animation. The transition to the iOS 7 style of design (flat and minimal) seems to have helped as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-best-thing-about-working-in-apps-and-mobile&quot;&gt;What is the best thing about working in apps and mobile?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the varied work. It can be difficult sometimes with deadlines and quite a big responsibility if your app is in millions of peoples hands but there is a huge amount of variety. I never really know what I’m going to be working on next which I find exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-one-thing-youd-like-to-change-about-app-development&quot;&gt;What is the one thing you’d like to change about app development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have two big gripes which are more to do with people than app development itself; being told I should port my apps to Android (“you’d make so much more money”) and being pitched an idea which isn’t so much an app as a service that requires servers, infrastructure, and has large operating costs (“I want an app that can let people upload photos and videos – I’ll give you 25% of the profit if you build it for free”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-mobile-devices-do-you-use&quot;&gt;What mobile devices do you use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I use an iPhone 6 Plus and an iPad Air at the moment. I’m particularly interested in the rumoured 12” iPad Pro although I have something similar in the form of the 12” Macbook which I take to client meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-your-favourite-apps--games&quot;&gt;What are your favourite apps / games?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ironically I don’t actually use that many apps beyond the stock things like mail. I’d say my most used 3rd party apps are Dark Sky for their weather alerts and Philips Hue for turning the lights on and off in my house. With games, I tend to play something solidly for a week and then get bored of it; I’m currently playing Alto’s Adventure, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and Kindo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-you-think-of-the-apple-watch&quot;&gt;What do you think of the Apple Watch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love my Apple Watch. It’s definitely a luxury rather than a necessity but I love getting notifications on my wrist, the fitness features, and Apple Pay. I’m looking forward to watchOS 2 especially as then I’ll be able to log a swim and have it count towards my exercise totals. It’ll be interesting to see how much better the 3rd party app experience is when the update arrives – I’ve dabbled with developing a few apps but the lag talking to the iPhone always limited the amount I could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Microsoft Bridge and the "App Gap"</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/08/19/microsoft-bridge-and-the-app-gap/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/08/19/microsoft-bridge-and-the-app-gap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked my opinion on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/&quot;&gt;Windows Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the “App Gap” between iOS, Android, and Windows Phone by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/will-windows-bridge-be-enough-get-ios-developers-cross-over-microsoft-terri/2015-08-18&quot;&gt;FierceDeveloper&lt;/a&gt;. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/will-windows-bridge-be-enough-get-ios-developers-cross-over-microsoft-terri/2015-08-18&quot;&gt;the article on their website&lt;/a&gt; but I’ve also put the full questions that were put to me along with my answers below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;would-something-like-windows-bridge-make-you-any-more-likely-to-bring-your-apps-to-windows-phone-why-or-why-not&quot;&gt;Would something like Windows Bridge make you any more likely to bring your apps to Windows Phone? Why or why not?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t convince me as there are two big problems: firstly, it only works with Objective-C whilst I have already made the switch over to Swift so I wouldn’t be able to make use of this (and the benefits of Swift massively outnumber the benefits of being on Windows Phone for me); secondly, whilst it may be easy to port an Objective-C app over, I would still need to build a custom Windows UI which would take a long time. In addition, this custom UI would need to be supported as and when new devices and screen sizes come out and I’d need to maintain feature parity between iOS and Windows making every release take significantly longer to bring to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-you-think-are-the-biggest-reasons-for-the-app-gap-between-apples-app-store-and-whats-available-in-microsofts-app-store&quot;&gt;What do you think are the biggest reasons for the “app gap” between Apple’s App Store and what’s available in Microsoft’s app store?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons for this but I think the two bigs ones are developer usage and money. When the iPhone came out, it was revolutionary and most developers who work in mobile began due to using an iPhone and wanting to write apps on it (that is certainly true in my case). That meant the iPhone got a lot of exciting apps developed on it first as the people that made those apps used iPhones. Over time, this has compounded into giving an Apple a massive advantage and whilst Android has caught up in many regards they haven’t got anywhere close when it comes to money. Simply put, iOS users spend more than Android users. I don’t know if that is due to the security and convenience of iTunes and TouchID or whether it is a more social thing (you’ve spent $700 on a phone so what is $100 a year on apps) but in all of the research I’ve done it has been the case that iOS users are willing to pay where Android users are not. It is for that reason I don’t port any of my apps to Android. Back to Microsoft though, the reason there is an app gap is that all of the developers started on iOS (and now Android) leading to a shortage of apps - this led to less customers and thus less money so they are now in the situation where it is very hard to attract developers as there are neither usage numbers nor financial figures to entice us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-there-more-microsoft-couldshould-do-to-make-developers-more-interested-in-creating-apps-and-games-for-their-platform&quot;&gt;Is there more Microsoft could/should do to make developers more interested in creating apps and games for their platform?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t think there is much Microsoft can do at this point. Consumers are simply not buying Windows Phones and that is the real problem. Whilst their initiatives such as building one app that can run on Windows 10, Xbox One, and Windows Phone are interesting, there simply isn’t enough consumer interest nor money to get iOS and Android developers to create apps on those platforms. Ultimately, Microsoft would probably be better chasing the gaming market over the app market - produce a Windows Phone that is more akin to a Playstation Vita and is able to run games that can also run on Xbox One and Windows 10. These wouldn’t be massively powerful games but would fit in with the “write once, run everywhere” better than apps do (typically games are used to having to scale at different resolutions and have custom UIs whereas regular apps tend to be designed to the UI of the platform making “write once, run everywhere” unfeasible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>LEGO Scooby-Doo</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/31/lego-scooby-doo/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/31/lego-scooby-doo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons but Scooby-Doo has always been my favourite so I’ve been looking forward to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com/en-gb/scoobydoo&quot;&gt;LEGO Scooby-Doo sets&lt;/a&gt; which officially launch tomorrow. Luckily, due to an error on the part of Argos&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:argos&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:argos&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I was able to get all five sets a week early so I’ve put together a very brief review. Make sure you scroll to the bottom to see the coolest feature which appears in every set!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mummy-museum-mystery&quot;&gt;Mummy Museum Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/mummy-mystery.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
This is the cheapest of the sets but it has a lot of detail for such a small set. Scooby and Shaggy come in every set but are joined by a mummy complete with headpiece. The museum itself has a hidden compartment with jewels and a liftable sarcophagus in which to hide the mummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mystery-plane-adventures&quot;&gt;Mystery Plane Adventures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/mystery-plane.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
This is my least favourite set but you do get a fair amount for the low price. Scooby, Shaggy, and a headless horseman complete with a bi-plane with revolving propellor and (for some reason) burger bombs&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sandwiches&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sandwiches&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that you can detach. The Scooby model in this one is slightly different to the others in that he is wearing flying goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mystery-machine&quot;&gt;The Mystery Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/mystery-machine.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
Now we’re getting to the good stuff. The Mystery Machine is iconic and I’ve no doubt that, at the low price, this will be the most purchased set in this series. For under £30, you get Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, a zombie, a scary tree, and the Mystery Machine itself. The model is much smaller than I’d originally anticipated but it is very detailed and opens up allowing access to the inside which contains a kitchen and some props like a camera and torch. Overall, this is a fantastic set although it does use a huge amount of stickers which are prominently visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;haunted-lighthouse&quot;&gt;Haunted Lighthouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/haunted-lighthouse.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
This may be my favourite set as it captures everything great about Scooby-Doo. You get a lighthouse keeper (it must have been him), swamp creature, Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, a speedboat (with skis), and an awesome rock formation with lighthouse and secret pirate cave. There are nice little touches such as scratches inside the prison cell to show that somebody had been counting days, a wonky “keep out” sign, and a face on the hidden cave complete with gold tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mystery-mansion&quot;&gt;Mystery Mansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/mystery-mansion.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
The biggest and most expensive of the sets, the Mystery Mansion shares a lot in common with the retired “&lt;a href=&quot;http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Fighters&quot;&gt;Monster Fighters&lt;/a&gt;” sets that LEGO released in 2012 (of which I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Haunted-House-10228&quot;&gt;Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;, my all time favourite LEGO set). The mansion is broken into 3 core areas; a greenhouse (with man eating plant), kitchen, and the tower. I personally think the greenhouse is the most interesting as there is good use of transparent panes and wedges to give the impression of smashed glass. The tower also has a nice feature in that when you turn a knob at the back, the clock hand advances and a column in the middle rotates to switch from a bat to a place where you can stand the vampire minifigure. There are a lot of stickers although the majority are on transparent panes which I find transfer better than on bricks where a slight misplacement can look terrible. In terms of minifigures, you get Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:velma&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:velma&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a suit of armour, a ghost, and a vampire. Both the vampire and ghost glow in the dark if you shine light on them first. Overall, this is a great set for both adult collectors and for kids to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minifigures&quot;&gt;Minifigures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/scooby-gang.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
The main draw for most adult collectors will be the minifigures. Whilst Scooby&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:scooby&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:scooby&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Shaggy come in every set, Daphne appears in two, and Fred and Velma only appear in one each so you’ll need practically every set if you want all 5 of them. In terms of the figures themselves, the designs are perfect and I believe this is the first time that LEGO have done custom arms on licensed models (note how Shaggy’s arms show a t-shirt style rather than extending to the hand). However, the best thing of all in these sets are the villains…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/scooby-villains-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/scooby-villains-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
Every villain&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:almost&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:almost&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has a double-printed head so you can unmask them and mimic the whole “I would have gotten away with it too if it weren’t for you meddling kids” speech! This for me shows how much thought LEGO have put into these sets and makes every minifigure one worth having (whereas on face value&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ha&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ha&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; they seem a little bland being mainly reprints from other sets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I highly recommend the Scooby-Doo LEGO sets. They offer great value for money, especially for licensed sets, and will look good as display models for adult collectors whilst also being high in playability for kids. Don’t forget that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/1-blog/post/33&quot;&gt;LEGO Big Bang Theory set&lt;/a&gt; also launches tomorrow though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:argos&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They accidentally broke the embargoe and were selling them instore - I managed to rush to my local branch and get all 5 sets about an hour before the mistake was fixed and they were pulled. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:argos&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sandwiches&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Every set has Scooby and Shaggy but they also always have either a sandwich or a burger. On the cheaper sets they’re a bit oddly placed (i.e. in the Mummy Museum they are used as the lever for the sarcophagus) but they are quite nice as mini models. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sandwiches&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:velma&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mugwhe_nGL0&amp;amp;t=2m3s&quot;&gt;Nice read, Velma&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:velma&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:scooby&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/scooby-gang.jpg&quot;&gt;4 Scooby variants&lt;/a&gt;; one paw up, one paw up and scared, sat down and scared, and sat down with flying goggles. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:scooby&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:almost&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;OK, almost every villain. The zombie doesn’t have anything to cover the back so instead they have put a crease and some buttons to show it’s a mask. Genius. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:almost&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:ha&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*chortle*&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:ha&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The mobile web</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/28/the-mobile-web/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 22:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/28/the-mobile-web/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a huge amount of talk over the past couple of weeks about mobile browsers mainly due to two announcements at WWDC; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/&quot;&gt;Content Blockers in Safari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/news/&quot;&gt;Apple News&lt;/a&gt;. This has led to discussion of mobile ads as it has been discovered there are huge speed boosts to be made when certain elements are blocked (for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/6/24/an-hour-with-safari-content-blocker-in-ios-9&quot;&gt;iMore site weighs 14MB&lt;/a&gt; for something that is essentially plaintext). The thing that got me was when Niley Patel of The Verge created an article called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks&quot;&gt;The mobile web sucks&lt;/a&gt;” whilst failing to notice the irony that the article he created &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/&quot;&gt;takes 30s to load, and fetches 9.5MB across 263 HTTP requests&lt;/a&gt;. The bit that irritated me though was this passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, Apple News lets you publish directly onto iPhones, bypassing Apple’s own Safari browser, which feels mildly crazy. Yet there’s some excitement over this: I just read Ben Thompson’s excellent piece explaining how the ad market for smaller publishers leads inexorably to bloated web pages that load poorly. That piece was itself a response to John Gruber saying that Apple’s new Safari Content Blocker system would cause a “reckoning” for publishers by letting users block performance-degrading Javascript. And yes, most commercial web pages are overstuffed with extremely complex ad tech, but it’s a two-sided argument: we should expect browser vendors to look at the state of the web and push their browsers to perform better, just as we should expect web developers to look at browser performance and trim the fat. But right now, the conversation appears to be going in just one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And that’s troubling. Taken together, Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles are the saddest refutation of the open web revolution possible: they are incompatible proprietary publishing systems entirely under the control of huge corporations, neither of which particularly understands publishing or media. Earlier this year, I called Facebook the new AOL; Instant Articles comes from the same instinct as AOL trying to bring Time Warner’s media content into its app just before the web totally kicked its ass. Apple and Facebook are turning their back on the web to build replacements for the web, and with them replacements for HTML and CSS and every bit of web innovation it’s taken 20 years of competitive development to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not 100% sure on Facebook Instant Articles but Apple News is basically just an RSS reader. Sure you can use some &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/News_Publishing_Guide/RSSBestPractices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015407-CH13-SW1&quot;&gt;custom syntax to make things look slightly nicer&lt;/a&gt; but they have “over a million topics” because they’ve basically scraped all the big RSS feeds and packaged it nicely. This brings me to the one thing I probably agree with Niley on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:bracelet&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:bracelet&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the mobile web does suck. The difference is that I don’t ever use it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On mobile, apps have completely replaced the web for me. Safari isn’t on my first home screen, let alone my dock; it’s buried in a folder with Stocks, Tips, and other undeletable&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:undeletable&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:undeletable&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Apple apps. The majority of browsing I do on my phone is either my RSS feeds or Twitter; if I want to read a link, they usually open in their own browser and I usually regret it. Mobile web sites are generally horrible things that are slow to load and have ridiculous interfaces. There are some sites that take longer to load on 4G than the equivelant WAP&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wap&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; website used to on GPRS! Even the option to choose to render the desktop version often doesn’t work due to the horrible way in which most companies detect you are using a mobile browser. Due to this, I typically save websites I want to read to my Pinboard and read them later on my iMac or use the “readability” feature in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love RSS feeds. I subscribe to around 130 websites&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:subscribe&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:subscribe&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I get every article fast, cached for offline usage, rendered in the same font, and without any JavaScript crap. I simply don’t understand people that don’t use RSS. Twitter is no match; you have to scroll through a ton of stuff you aren’t interested in to find links which you then have to click and wait for your browser to render. RSS keeps everything uniform and consistent and ensures I don’t miss anything. That is essentially what Apple News is trying to do (albeit with a discovery angle and a bit more design) and it seems like a perfectly good idea to me but I doubt it’ll make me switch from &lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbin.com/&quot;&gt;FeedBin&lt;/a&gt;, my current setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only minor problem I have with RSS is sites (&lt;s&gt;like The Verge&lt;/s&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:theverge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:theverge&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) who only give you a paragraph of the text before making you click through to the site so they get your eyeballs on their ads and which always leads to clickbait headlines and paragraphs ending in a manufactured cliffhanger&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:remove&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:remove&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Fortunately there aren’t many sites that do that but Apple News is not going to fix it; they have provision for this with a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/News_Publishing_Guide/RSSBestPractices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015407-CH13-SW1&quot;&gt;Read Full Story” link&lt;/a&gt; they embed that opens up the rest of the page within an internal browser. There are also sites which have ads as content (i.e. Daring Fireball) but those work well as they can be skimmed over quickly if they are of no interest and they don’t track you, take over your screen, or do any of the other things that browser ads do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whilst everybody is up in arms about mobile browsers using up their battery and CPU, tracking their usage across the web, and having the unwinnable argument over whether to block ads or not&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:blockads&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:blockads&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I’ll be sat reading that debate in my JavaScript-free, fast, RSS reader. I’ll likely end up installing some form of content blocker when iOS 9 is released for the few times that I do end up using the browser, but those times are thankfully becoming fewer and fewer on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:bracelet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have an instant dislike to him after his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review&quot;&gt;Apple Watch review&lt;/a&gt; (which has a horrible, horrible website) in which he said the notifications made him ruder in conversation (as he constantly looked at his watch rather than ignoring it - that just makes him a jerk, not the watch) and claimed he felt “ridiculous wearing the Milanese Loop” yet is happy to wear a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1031596&quot;&gt;massive chunky punk bracelet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:bracelet&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:undeletable&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m still surprised this hasn’t been remedied. In iOS 3 you could enable the Nike Running app by a toggle in settings (as the 3GS had the Bluetooth chip to talk to the shoe tracker) so I don’t see an issue why the built-in apps couldn’t be turned off in a similar way from settings. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:undeletable&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:wap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Who remembers WAP? Fun times. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:wap&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:subscribe&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A mixture of tech, politics, development, LEGO, video game, and Disney blogs. Everything published in the areas I care about all in one place. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:subscribe&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:theverge&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Turns out that The Verge does offer a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml&quot;&gt;full RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; after all! A shame that &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com&quot;&gt;9to5mac.com&lt;/a&gt; have started truncating theirs… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:theverge&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:remove&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After clicking a few of them, you realise the site is terrible and unsubscribe from it. Problem solved. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:remove&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:blockads&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The argument is either “if you block ads you are getting something for free and going to put the publisher out of business” or “you shouldn’t be using up my battery and CPU with this privacy invading advertising”. You can’t win either way. I block ads personally but I’ll do a post soon about how I do it on my iMac. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:blockads&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Finding the next available driving test with Goutte PHP Scraper</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/24/next-driving-test-with-goutte/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past week I’ve had a lot of fun working on some small scripts to aid my general day-to-day living. My wife is currently waiting to take her driving test but our local area only has one test instructor with a waiting list of over 6 months! Occassionally slots open up due to cancellations and so she has been logging into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://driverpracticaltest.direct.gov.uk/login&quot;&gt;Government website&lt;/a&gt; multiple times a day to check for a nearer date. Time for some automation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop her having to constantly go to a website, I decided to knock up a quick PHP script that would basically pretend to be a browser, log in, go to the correct page, and rip out the next available appointment. It’s been a while since I wrote a script like this so I had a look around for something better than &lt;code&gt;SimpleXML&lt;/code&gt; and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte&quot;&gt;Goutte, a simple PHP Web Scraper&lt;/a&gt;. Within 10 minutes, my script was working. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;vendor/autoload.php&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Goutte\Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$licenseNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;xxx&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Driving License Number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$referenceNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;xxx&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Reference number for current test date as looking to rebook&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://driverpracticaltest.direct.gov.uk/login&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;h2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, you can’t use this service right now&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Site is down.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inexplicably, the site goes offline from 9pm-6am. It thinks it&amp;#39;s an office!&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selectButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Continue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;username&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$licenseNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;password&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$referenceNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selectLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Change Date and time of test&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selectButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Find available dates&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;testChoice&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ASAP&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$crawler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;.slotDateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39; is the next available test slot.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Here I check if it has changed since last time and send an email if it has and nearer than currently booked test. Left out for brevity.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the code is pretty simple, readable, and powerful. Within minutes, I was able to jump through 3 pages without worrying about sessions, cookies, or any of the other nonsense that often occurred when dealing with this kind of scraping. I run this every 5 minutes on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortrabbit.com/&quot;&gt;FortRabbit server&lt;/a&gt; and we both get emailed if a closer test date appears. For just a few minutes work, this means better peace of mind as we don’t have to check manually and this checks far more frequently than we ever could. Now to wait and hope for a nearer test date…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TransferWise</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/17/transferwise/</link>

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/17/transferwise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://transferwise.com/u/135bb&quot;&gt;TransferWise&lt;/a&gt; for a little while but there new support for Apple Pay put it back in the front of my mind. TransferWise is a service that transfers money for you into multiple currencies at a fraction of the cost that your bank would usually charge. I’d seen it advertised a few times on Facebook but didn’t take too much notice as I didn’t really make any international transfers; that stopped when we &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/blog/apr-2014/design-team-update&quot;&gt;hired Robbie at WallaBee last year&lt;/a&gt;. I quickly found that my bank was not only charging me with exhorbitant conversion rates and transfer charges but that the recipient was also being charged by their bank for accepting an international transfer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way TransferWise works is that it lets you choose a specific amount of money to transfer (either in the original or converted currency&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:transfers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:transfers&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and then it tells you how much it thinks it will cost. You then pay that amount (plus a small buffer to account for fluctuating bank transfers) direct to TransferWise by card or bank transfer. They then do the conversion and pay the recipient from a local account in their own currency so they don’t get hit with international charges. Once it is all done, you get a refund for any of the amount that wasn’t used for the conversion. The first few times the transfer took around 5 working days but now my transfers are done within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve saved over £500 in fees over the past 6 months and couldn’t be happier with the service. I tend to use the website but they have a great iOS app which has recently been updated to accept Apple Pay. If you are making any sort of payments overseas, I’d strongly recommend using TransferWise rather than your standard banking transfers. If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://transferwise.com/u/135bb&quot;&gt;sign up with this link&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get a fee-free transfer of up to £3000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:transfers&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an important distinction as when paying an invoice I need to pay in a specific amount of USD so the amount of GBP will change. There may be situations where you always want send a specific amount of GBP and the USD will then be the thing that varies based on currency conversion. Obviously they support more than just USD / GBP but that’s all I use currently. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:transfers&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>UK Apple Pay</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been excited about Apple Pay ever since it was first announced for the US last year. It &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; arrived in the UK today and so I’ve made a few purchases in a selfless act of testing! There has been quite a bit of confusion and misinformation about how it would work in the UK so hopefully I’ll clear up some issues there as well as giving my opinion on how Apple Pay works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is insanely easy to setup. You just open up the Passbook app on your iPhone&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:applepayphone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:applepayphone&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a new “Pay” option will appear above your passes. When you add a card, Apple will automatically default to the card you have on file for iTunes purchases or you can add a new one via the camera. Some banks have a security step and I was offered the choice of calling RBS or having them text me a security code; the code came through instantly and everything activated within seconds. Unfortunately neither my credit card company nor my business bank are using Apple Pay yet so I could only add my personal account card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an Apple Watch, you need to repeat this step in the “Passbook &amp;amp; Apple Pay” section of the Apple Watch app. The reason for this is that your card information is stored securely within the hardware of the device, not in software (so there is no iCloud syncing or anything like that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to paying, you can use Apple Pay at every single shop in the UK that has a contactless card reader. When paying, you simply say you are paying by card and if the amount is under £20&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:contactlesslimit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:contactlesslimit&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the contactless section will light up and you can then place your iPhone near the reader. Your iPhone will automatically come out of standby mode, show your card, and ask you to hold the fingerprint scanner on the home button; within a second it’ll buzz and the payment is done. If paying with the Apple Watch you have to double-tap the side button to bring up your cards and then hold it against the scanner (for the simple reason that the NFC chip isn’t always on as it’d kill the battery). Once the payment is done, an unexpected nice touch is that you get a push notification telling you how much you paid and where - useful for making sure that you paid the correct amount. I tried this in W H Smiths, which is not an official “Apple Pay” partner, and it all went through fine. Your iPhone (or Apple Watch) is simply pretending to be a contactless card so if your card works, then Apple Pay will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main piece of misinformation about Apple Pay in the UK has been this £20 limit; “Apple Pay limited to £20” is a frequent headline but it isn’t actually true. If a launch partner (like Marks &amp;amp; Spencer) supports full Apple Pay, then you can make a purchase of over £20 using the same system as above. The difference is that they have upgraded their hardware so that the contactless part will work specifically with Apple Pay rather than just being the standard contactless payment system. I tested this by buying £35 of stuff at M&amp;amp;S and it all worked flawlessly. The real issue is that “Apple Pay” encompasses both the “pretending to be regular contactless” and “being an upgraded contactless system” and it isn’t easy to tell which a retailer supports. I think if you see an Apple Pay logo on the reader (like I did at McDonalds), then they support the full no transaction limit Apple Pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After successfully paying with both my iPhone and Apple Watch at multiple stores, I decided to give the in app payment system a try. This is live for several apps (highlighted in the App Store currently) and basically allows you to make payments in app using Apple Pay. This is limited to physical goods and services&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:iap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:iap&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I bought some stuff from Etsy, supported a project on Kickstarter, and bought a new Apple Watch strap from the Apple Store app. In all cases, the process was insanely simple; during the checkout process, I was never asked for my address or card details but a simple “Apple Pay” button bought up a sheet which showed the address my card is issued to and let me pay by holding my fingerprint on the home button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the whole process has been simple and fast. A lot of people wonder why bother using this when you can already use a contactless card? For me, it boils down to two reasons: simplicity and security. With my Apple Watch on, I didn’t have to take my wallet out of my pocket; whilst this isn’t a mindblowing change (only takes a second), it is an added level of convenience and means I can make purchases if I leave my wallet at home (or if I’m somewhere sketchy and don’t want to take it out). The real benefit though is in security. When you make a payment, the retailer never gets your card number; Apple Pay gives a randomly generated number every time you buy something which means retailers can’t track you across stores or link you to payments. I was able to check this by looking at my receipts and each time the last 4 digits they displayed of my card number were different. This may be a minor thing to a lot of people but this increase in privacy and the convenience of making payments (some of them over £20) from my wrist mean that this is a big deal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real test will be when I’m in London next and can try it out in place of an Oyster card&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:twist&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:twist&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:applepayphone&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Only iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are supported for Apple Pay via contactless payment. You can use iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 for in-app payments. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:applepayphone&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:contactlesslimit&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is increasing to £30 for all contactless payments in September. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:contactlesslimit&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:iap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously you can already pay for in-app purchases like extra game levels or subscriptions using TouchID which works essentially the same way but charges your card on your iTunes account. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:iap&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:twist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of comments about “the readers are on the right so how will I use it if I wear my watch on my left hand like 90% of the population”. I’ve got this clever trick called “moving your arm across your body”… worked like a charm at the McDonalds payment terminal. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:twist&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Forcing UIStatusBarStyle for UIImagePickerController</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/10/forcing-uistatusbarstyle-for-uiimagepickercontroller/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 16:35:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/10/forcing-uistatusbarstyle-for-uiimagepickercontroller/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon an interesting problem today which I’ve experienced a couple of times before; if you are using white text for the status bar in your application (&lt;code&gt;UIStatusBarStyle.LightContent&lt;/code&gt;) then it will be turned black once you present a UIImagePickerController. This can not only look ugly but will remain when you dismiss the controller. Usually I just change the appearance of the navigation bar within the picker to get around this (and set it back to the correct colour upon dismissing the controller) but on this particular app I wanted to force the UIImagePickerController to use the light style status bar. Fortunately it is quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use the UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, you are also required to adopt the UINavigationControllerDelegate. This has a method named &lt;code&gt;navigationController:willShowViewController:animated:&lt;/code&gt; which will be called both when you present the controller and when you navigate between albums. Using this, it is trivial to force the status bar to remain the same&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:assumption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:assumption&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;willShowViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;viewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;UIApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sharedApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;statusBarStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LightContent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:assumption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is of course assuming you have &lt;em&gt;View controller-based status bar appearance&lt;/em&gt; set to NO in your Info.plist file so that you can use UIApplication to change the status bar. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:assumption&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Optical media and the pain of Remote Disc</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/10/optical-media-and-the-pain-of-remote-disc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate optical media. I avoid it as much as possible with streaming or digital versions of music and films but sometimes it is unavoidable. An album I wanted&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:lacage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:lacage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; recently wasn’t available on iTunes or any of the other online stores so I had to give in and buy a physical version on Amazon. Unfortunately this didn’t give me a free MP3 version as it often does&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:amazonmp3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:amazonmp3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which left me with a slight issue as neither my iMac nor MacBook have a CD drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think this would be a big problem as my wife has an older MacBook with an optical drive so I’d be able to use Remote Disc to access the drive. Remote Disc is a useful feature that lets you access the optical drive on another computer via your network and has been useful for me in the past if I’ve had some data lying around on an old disc. Unfortunately, it didn’t work at all for this as &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203973&quot;&gt;Remote Disc is locked to prevent the streaming of audio discs (or movie DVDs)&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, Remote Disc doesn’t straight up tell you this but instead gives you a cryptic message about the drive being unavailable. I can see no logical reason for this but that is still the state of play in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I had to rip the CD on my wife’s MacBook, then copy the files back to my computer. Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:lacage&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The album, in case you were wondering, was the original Broadway version of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007IJKHIQ?keywords=la%20cage%20aux%20folles&amp;amp;qid=1436518617&amp;amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;La Cage Aux Folles&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:lacage&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:amazonmp3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In ridiculous circumstances, it is often cheaper to buy a physical CD from Amazon than it is to buy the MP3 version! They sometimes give you the digital version free with the physical so I bought “Bright Idea” by Orson and just recycled the Amazon package that arrived without opening. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:amazonmp3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Adding Exercise Data To Activity</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/07/07/adding-exercise-data-to-activity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the health features of the Apple watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/26/working-out-with-apple-watch/&quot;&gt;a lot recently&lt;/a&gt; but today is the first time it has stopped me from doing a specific exercise. I was planning on going for a swim but obviously I don’t want to do that with my watch on. I assumed I’d be able to either enter the workout directly into the Health app (or use a 3rd party app to add the data to HealthKit) and that would then count as part of my 30 minutes of exercise on the Apple Watch; unfortunately this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried with manual data entry and 3rd party apps&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:healththird&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:healththird&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but there is no way for workout data not created on the Apple Watch to be used as part of your Activity… yet. On checking the WWDC keynote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02H3vfFW3xg&amp;amp;t=1h31m53s&quot;&gt;Kevin Lynch mentions that this feature is coming as part of watchOS 2&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically he says that “workouts with these [native on the Apple Watch] apps will count” - I’m assuming that any app that uses HealthKit will actually count but we’ll see. I’m not going to install a potentially buggy watchOS 2 on my Apple Watch one week before Apple Pay comes to the UK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:healththird&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I even built my own basic app to add data into HealthKit with the “user entered” flag set to false in the hope that this was the piece that meant the Apple Watch ignored it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:healththird&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Since, an NSDate Extension in Swift</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/06/23/since-an-nsdate-extension-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve just &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/nsdate-since-swift&quot;&gt;committed a very simple NSDate extension&lt;/a&gt; that gives you a human readable version of the time difference between the date and now (i.e. “2 hours ago”, “just now”, or “last week”). I needed this functionality in a project I’m currently working on but existing solutions I found were all Objective-C and fairly complex. I try not to add any complex 3rd party dependencies when I don’t have to (especially as I don’t want an Objective-C bridging header) so I built this in a few minutes to give me the basic functionality I required. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/nsdate-since-swift&quot;&gt;check it out on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this sums up how I feel about some development today. Many developers will either embed a 3rd party solution without thinking about it (giving you licensing and support issues in the future) or they’ll spend hours crafting the perfect solution that will give you to-the-second precision with unit tests and a whole host of other stuff you probably don’t need&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:craft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:craft&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Sometimes you just need the simplest thing that works so you can move onto more important things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:craft&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/&quot;&gt;oft-mentioned story about Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; regards how his father would spend as much time making the back of a cabinet (which you’d never see) look as good as the front as a sign of good craftsmanship. This has its place but its important to remember that “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt&quot;&gt;real artists ship&lt;/a&gt;”; I’d rather have a project that is live and performing than spend hours crafting the “perfect” piece of code. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:craft&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using an SSD with the Xbox One</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/06/19/using-an-ssd-with-xbox-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/06/19/using-an-ssd-with-xbox-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my Xbox One but the one big issue I have with it is loading times. This is mainly due to the spinning hard drive&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:gross&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:gross&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; inside and the huge amount of data it is expected to push for some of the bigger open world games like GTA V or The Witcher 3. In an effort to speed this up (and because the 500GB hard drive is almost full), I’ve upgraded my Xbox One with an external SSD&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:internal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:internal&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is actually incredibly simple. You’ll need the following two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An mSATA SSD that is at least 256GB in size. I went for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00K64I1ZG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00K64I1ZG&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=bendodsoncom-21&amp;amp;linkId=WXUCET2UPLRQ45JG&quot;&gt;256GB model from Transcend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A USB 3.0 enclosure for the SSD. You’ll want one that has UASP support like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00RNECU36/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00RNECU36&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=bendodsoncom-21&amp;amp;linkId=2PBC3FWRNMFY46HQ&quot;&gt;this one from ZTC&lt;/a&gt;. Do not get one from Sabrent&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sabrent&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sabrent&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/ssd-and-enclosure.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have these, it’s a simple case of plugging the SSD into the enclosure and attaching the USB cable. This leaves you with an incredibly small device which can then be plugged into any of the 3 USB 3.0 ports on the Xbox One:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/ssd-for-xbox-one.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you turn the Xbox One on, you’ll be alerted that a new media device has been attached and given the option to format it for games and give it a name. When you have done this, you’ll be able to copy games and apps by going to their individual storage settings and choosing the move option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only put 3 games on the SSD so far but they are all dramatically faster for loading and saving. I’ve put a few benchmarks below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gta-v&quot;&gt;GTA V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far my slowest game. Testing was from a cold startup (which automatically loads your previous save point) to the point at which the game was playable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal HDD&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 minutes 31 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External SSD&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 minute 9 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSD produces a 60% reduction in loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-witcher-3-wild-hunt&quot;&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first test was from a cold start to the opening menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal HDD&lt;/strong&gt; - 40s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External SSD&lt;/strong&gt; - 28s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSD produces a 30% reduction in loading time (although that seemed to be as quick as it could go due to the logos and publisher videos at startup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second test was from resuming a game from the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal HDD&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 minute 21 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External SSD&lt;/strong&gt; - 46 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSD produces a 57% reduction in loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lego-jurassic-world&quot;&gt;LEGO Jurassic World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this test, I timed from the loading of the last save point on the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal HDD&lt;/strong&gt; - 37 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External HDD&lt;/strong&gt; - 37 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like LEGO Jurassic World’s loading sequence is limited to 37 seconds in order to show 3 pieces of dinosaur trivia at 12 seconds each. Playing through the game though, the time it takes to start a story and fast travel to new locations seems much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it seems that the SSD offers around a 55-60% reduction in speed unless there is something specifically limiting the load time (i.e. videos or placeholder content). I’m planning on just using the external drive for single player games at the moment as there isn’t much benefit in loading the Titanfall or Halo online textures any quicker when the limiting factor is the broadband connection along with everyone else. For me, the SSD option is definitely worth the cost for the big open world games that have a heavy loading time penalty when you die (looking at you GTA V) - it has also increased my overall storage space by 50% which is useful when some games are in the 100s of GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:gross&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Gross! One day I’ll look forward to telling my kids we used to store data on discs spinning at 7200rpm - it’ll be baffling to them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:gross&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:internal&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As far as I’m aware, doing it internally would be slightly faster but would definitely invalidate any warranty! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:internal&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sabrent&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first enclosure I got was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00LRZPNHM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00LRZPNHM&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=bendodsoncom-21&amp;amp;linkId=SS2QV56CLPEMMOBV&quot;&gt;EC-UKMS from Sabrent&lt;/a&gt; which was advertised as having UASP. It doesn’t and led to a 70% &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in speed over the internal HDD with a load time of over 4 minutes for GTA V! This is the first product I’ve actually left a review for on Amazon as the title and images are blatent lies. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sabrent&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Glenfiddich Residence Changhi</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/29/glenfiddich-residence-changhi/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2015 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/29/glenfiddich-residence-changhi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An iPad app I worked on a little while ago has recently gone live at a popup store in Changhi Airport: &lt;strong&gt;Glenfiddich Residence&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a little different to the work I usually do as it isn’t for distribution on the App Store or ad hoc for enterprise but for a single iPad locked in a display stand. The app is part of a large installation to showcase a limited edition of Glenfiddich which is available exclusively at Changhi Airport. The single cask&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:cask&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:cask&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that has been selected by Glenfiddich is on display within a specially constructed glass chamber that showcases the weather and atmospheric conditions of the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/glenfiddich-cask.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad app allows for customers to see the current conditions in Dufftown including temperature, wind speed and direction, weather conditions, and the local time. This is paired with multiple sound effects which match with the weather conditions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:weather&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:weather&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The app also talks with a control PC via a direct socket connection over WiFi in order to control the weather effects within the chamber simulating morning fog, wind, and even rain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/glenfiddich-app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a continuous slideshow of images from around the distillery and nearly everything is animated to entice customers to interact with it. All conditions are in realtime from a weather station near the distillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final aspect is the “start movie” button which reduces the weather effects and begins playback of a video from the Glenfiddich Malt Master on a 1080p portrait screen inside the glass chamber. This video gives an overview of the distillery and details on the bottles from the limited edition cask that are available at the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is written entirely in Swift 1.2 and the iPad is locked down with Guided Access to prevent customers accessing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really exciting project to work on as it is very different to the usual iOS apps I do. If you’re visiting Changhi Airport or passing through, be sure to visit the Glenfiddich Residence; I believe it will be there for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:cask&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cask #8247 with a 1992 Glenfiddich to be precise. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:cask&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:weather&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, a thunder storm with a strong wind will have a very different array of sounds to a sunny day with no wind. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:weather&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Working out with Apple Watch</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/26/working-out-with-apple-watch/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 16:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/26/working-out-with-apple-watch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get fitter, I’ve been using the two exercise apps available on the Apple Watch; Workout and Activity. It seemed strange to me that they were separate apps (which also feed into the Activity and Health apps on the iPhone) but after a bit of time with them I’m starting to understand the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;activity&quot;&gt;Activity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch tries to get you active by introducing you to the three activity circles; Move, Exercise, and Stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move&lt;/strong&gt;: This is basically active calories and is a measurement of how much movement you’ve done. Your goal is based on height and weight but mine started off at 410 calories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not 100% sure on how this is calculated but it seems to be doing anything that gets your heart rate up. The goal is 30 minutes per day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand&lt;/strong&gt;: This is designed to make you stand up for at least 1 minute every hour. If you get to 50 minutes past the hour and you haven’t stood up, you get a little reminder. The goal is 12 instances of standing for 1 minute per hour (so standing up for 12 minutes in a row won’t complete the circle - has to be at least 1 minute for 12 hours).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the goals, there are also awards to motivate you to complete your circles each day. These look really nice&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:olympics&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:olympics&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and they use a decent curve so you start off getting quite a lot of achievements in order to make you persist with it. I’ve got most of them now so the next major ones are more tricky ones like “reach your move goal 100 times” or “complete your circles for every day of a month”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/awards.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;activity-complication&quot;&gt;Activity Complication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about the circular design they’ve gone for is that it fits nicely as a complication on the watch face. I alternate between two watch faces — &lt;em&gt;Simple&lt;/em&gt; in the week, &lt;em&gt;Mickey&lt;/em&gt; at the weekends — and Activity is the only complication I have active (aside from the date). It highlights the best use of a complication in that I can quickly glance at my watch without touching it and see how far I am for each of my goals; if I want to see specifics, I can tap the complication to go into the Activity app proper. I used to use a FitBit&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fitbit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fitbit&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the problem with those is that you either had to use the iPhone app to see how far you’d got or tap multiple times to go through the different views (steps, distance, calories, etc). With the Apple Watch, I can see the 3 important things without getting my phone out and that is a big advantage in my opinion&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:advantage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:advantage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is very motivating as you can see how close you are to completing a circle throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/activity-complication.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workout&quot;&gt;Workout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the app to use when you are doing a proper piece of exercise. There are presets for things like Running, Walking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:walking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:walking&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Cycling, etc, but I’ve been using the Elliptical whilst on my Crosstrainer. I’m desperately unfit so I only do a 15-minute session each day (along with a brisk walk to get to my 30 minutes of Exercise) but the app is quite good at prompting me to extend my session on the next day. You get tapped when you’re at the halfway point and you can check your heart rate and calories burned during the workout. Speaking of heart rate, the Apple Watch does continuously track your heart rate throughout the day at intervals of around 10-20 minutes (it seems to check more the more movement you are doing). However, if you are doing a workout, it constantly checks your heart rate in order to more accurately see how many calories are being burned. I like to listen to music whilst I’m exercising so I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones which I pair to the watch (not my phone) and then I listen to a playlist I have synced across. This means I can exercise without my phone. I haven’t tried this on a run but my wife has and on doing a few runs with and without her phone the measurements are pretty accurate (on an 8 mile run, the distance was only off by 0.05 miles compared to GPS). When you finish a workout, you are given the option to “save” or “discard” it - this was slightly confusing as when you press “save” you are taken back to the app carousel and there is no way of seeing those stats again on the watch&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:save&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:save&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It turns out the workout is actually saved to the Activity app on the iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;activity-iphone-app&quot;&gt;Activity iPhone App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Activity app on the iPhone only appears once you have paired an Apple Watch. It works the same as the Activity app on the watch in that you have your 3 circles but the difference is that you can see historical data here, review your achievements, and see more numbers and graphs. The History window shows your circles at a glance but if you pull from the left you can see how your daily move goal has changed over time (so in the screenshots below you can see how this week the watch asked me if I wanted to increase my daily move goal from 410 calories to 450 calories):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/activity-app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also look at your day and your workouts in more detail such as this elliptical workout I did at lunchtime today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/workout.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweeted about this over the weekend but one of the most motivating things for me has been the “Avg Heart Rate” on the above screen. Each day over the past week, that number has decreased with the same 15 minute workout which shows (I think) an improvement in my overall fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;health-iphone-app&quot;&gt;Health iPhone App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the fitness puzzle is the Health app on the iPhone. This came as part of iOS 8 and is a way for you to store all of your health data securely. There are loads of apps which can read and write to this store and the Apple Watch is no exception. By default, it will populate the Flights Climbed, Steps, Walking + Running Distance, Active Calories, Workouts, and Heart Rate sections. You can choose to display each of these as graphs within the app although I’m hoping for more control over this in future versions as you can’t view specific dates, only “Today”, “Week”, “Month”, and “Year”. This is one of those areas where the continuous heart rate monitoring is really nice as you can get an overall picture of how much you are fluctuating throughout the day - whilst there are plenty of heart rate monitors available on the market, one you don’t have to think about that is constantly monitoring will always win out (and it is incredibly accurate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/health-app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A small aside, my Apple Watch has just told me to stand up. The nice thing about it doing it 10 minutes before the hour is up is that I often have things scheduled on the hour like phone calls. It’s turned into a nice reminder that I should go and get a drink&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:water&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:water&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and have a stretch before next hour of work. It is definitely one of those small things I didn’t think about when the Apple Watch was announced but it is the thing that has changed my behaviour more than anything else.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I’ve found the Apple Watch to be a much better fitness companion than I expected. My assumption was that it would cater for those that like to do running and cycling but wouldn’t do much for the more casual exerciser. In actual fact, it has made me more aware of how little movement I was doing and also helped motivate me more to do things as simple as standing every hour. The majority of its features can be done on other devices, such as the FitBit, but the tight integration is key. The heart rate monitoring showing up in the Health app satisfies the stats nerd part of me whilst the simplicity of 3 goals per day has definitely made me more likely to succeed as I don’t want to break the streak I’m on. If you’ve got the Apple Watch and haven’t explored the exercise parts, I’d definitely recommend giving it a go; once you’ve done it for a day or two, you’ll find it very hard to stop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:olympics&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Apparently they were inspired by Olympic medals. They do look really nice especially when animating - the black background definitely helps make them stand out more than something like Game Center achievements. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:olympics&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fitbit&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I started with the FitBit One, then went up to the Flex, and eventually the Charge. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fitbit&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:advantage&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A summary of the Apple Watch could really be “something that makes interactions quicker” - it isn’t necessary but it feels so good to be able to get things done quickly. “But it only takes 5 seconds to get your phone out and check it” I hear you cry; true, but those instances add up. Like I say, it isn’t necessary but it’s definitely nice. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:advantage&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:walking&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I did this a few times whilst walking the dogs but I don’t log them anymore - a walk isn’t really a workout in my eyes. Also, you still get credit towards your Exercise ring if you go for a walk but don’t activate a workout - it knows when you are walking briskly and so that does count as exercise. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:walking&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:save&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’ll show you how long your last workout was and when it was when you open the Workout app but you can’t see calories burned, average heart rate, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:save&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:water&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve also been trying to drink the recommended amount of water per day so this has been a good point to go and top up my water. I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://waterminderapp.com&quot;&gt;WaterMinder app&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of this as they have a nice Apple Watch app which follows a similar circular goal design. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:water&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Using Stripe for In-App Purchases</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/22/using-stripe-for-iap/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2015 18:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/22/using-stripe-for-iap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/unique/&quot;&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; for WallaBee a few years ago, I didn’t completely grasp how popular they’d be. Within a few weeks, we had hundreds of orders (all processed through PayPal) and ended up with a year-long backlog which has only now been cleared. In anticipation of allowing players to commission these items again, I’ve been looking at payment providers and settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; now that they’ve fully launched in the UK. After having a quick look at their docs, I realised it was going to be insanely easy to integrate their SDK into a website and that is when I started thinking about using them for In-App Purchases (IAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple allow developers to use their StoreKit to create In-App Purchases but it comes at a steep price: 30% of all sales. For that 30%, you get simplicity and ease of use for the customer who can just tap a button, type in their iTunes password, and buy any digital content upto $999. This is what we’ve been using with WallaBee for over 3 years but with several issues arising lately&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:storekit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:storekit&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I thought I might have a go at creating a way for players to buy our in-game currency and lock mechanisms on our website. After a couple of hours, I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;fully functioning site&lt;/a&gt; which does just that with full integration with Stripe. Players log in and then click a button to begin using Checkout, Stripe’s own JavaScript based checkout system which will either operate in an overlay on desktop or open in a new window on mobile. The card form is incredibly simple (and no doubt well tested) and allows customers to pay within seconds. It also has the ability to remember a customer so later purchases will be quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result so far has been that 50% of our players have chosen to purchase online&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:incentive&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:incentive&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which adds up to a sizeable increase in income as Stripe charge roughly 4-5% once currency conversion (if necessary) is taken into account. Another nice benefit is that Stripe pay you daily for transactions 7 days ago - that means the sales from today will be in our account next week whereas with Apple we have to wait as long as 2 months for a transaction to be paid. We also get more control over the refund process as at the moment anybody can ask Apple for a refund and will usually get it - we don’t get notified when that happens so it means some players can get purchases for free&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:theft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:theft&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue with this is that it has to be completely confined to the web and we’re not allowed to add a buy button or similar to the app to direct people to the purchase site as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#purchasing-currencies&quot;&gt;rule 11.13 of the App Store Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.13&lt;/strong&gt;: Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the App, such as a “buy” button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is permissable to sell content for your apps online, you’re just not allowed to have any buttons linking to the site within the app. This means that we’ll need to keep both the Apple IAP system and our Stripe online system running separately but so far the results look good. If you have some form of gaming app that relies on IAP, you’d be crazy not to look at doing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:storekit&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems to be that if Apple changes it’s ToS, players who make a purchase are then asked to verify their agreement and end up getting charged without having the charge hit my servers so they end up getting nothing. There is also a complex dance to verify everything with a successful purchase going to my server, my server verifying with Apple, Apple replying that it’s all ok, and then me adding the purchase to the database - if a connection is dropped at any point, then customer ends up with nothing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:storekit&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:incentive&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No doubt helped by the 5% discount we added whilst trialling it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:incentive&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:theft&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve not seen many instances of this but it has happened and there isn’t anything we can do about it as Apple don’t say who has been refunded, just that a refund has occurred. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:theft&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>iTunes Artwork Finder Source Code</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/20/itunes-artwork-finder-source-code/</link>

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/20/itunes-artwork-finder-source-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an email this morning from a developer who wanted to connect directly to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;iTunes Artwork Finder&lt;/a&gt; in order to power their own artwork finding app. This seemed like a good time to point out that there is no need to do this&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:servers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:servers&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as I have the source code freely available for everyone on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a developer and you want to use my API for iTunes Artwork, please instead get the source code and host it on your own server. You can get the code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:servers&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And I’d prefer that people didn’t for two reasons; it costs me money in bandwidth to hit the iTunes Search API on your behalf and it is more likely to result in my IP addresses being banned by Apple which would take the service down for everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:servers&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>A Month-Year UIPickerView Written In Swift</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/19/monthyearpickerview-swift/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve just shared some code on GitHub which may be useful to somebody; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/MonthYearPickerView-Swift&quot;&gt;MonthYearPickerView-Swift&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a basic UIPickerView subclass that allows you to choose just a month and year in a scrolling picker. This is useful for things such as expiration dates on credit cards. It uses a simple block-based callback to let you know once a date has been selected and may be a good way of seeing how to make other custom pickers if you are new to iOS or Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/MonthYearPickerView-Swift&quot;&gt;MonthYearPickerView-Swift on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-10-07):&lt;/strong&gt; The project has been updated to support Swift 2.0 and is compatible with Storyboards and Xib files. I’ve added tags to the repository so you can choose if you want the Swift 1.2 or Swift 2.0 version.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TV for the UK politics fan</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/05/tv-for-the-uk-politics-fan/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2015 19:30:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With just 1 day left until the 2015 General Election, I thought it might be fun to put together a list of some of my favourite TV shows that show how UK politics works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blackadder&quot;&gt;Blackadder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the finest episodes is the series 3 opener, “Dish and Dishonesty”, which covers the by-election of “Dunny-on-the-Wold” as Blackadder attempts to stop Pitt the Younger from striking the Prince from the civil list. Every line is a winner but my one of my favourites has to be “Marvelous thing, democracy. Look at Manchester: population, 60,000; electoral roll, 3”. Also notable for the fact that the “Standing-At-The-Back-Dressed-Stupidly-And-Looking-Stupid Party” appear to be wearing UKIP colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eb25pO04yls&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thick-of-it&quot;&gt;The Thick Of It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really just a modern version of “Yes, Minister” (which I’ll come to) covering the last Labour Government with the more recent series looking at the current coalition. Made famous by Peter “Doctor Who” Capaldi’s sweary Malcolm Tucker character, it’s a very accurate portrayal of how UK politics has been for the last few years with special advisors holding much of the power. One of the best episodes for me involves the minister going on a factory visit&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:factory&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:factory&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and being accosted by a worker unhappy with the state of the NHS…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rcivx8NW6U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yes-minister&quot;&gt;Yes, Minister&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made during the 80s, “Yes, Minister” was a comedy portrayal of the struggle between ministers and their civil servants. Every episode is fantastic, as is the related series “Yes, Prime Minister”, with the witty dialogue of Sir Humphrey Appleby providing the best laughs. I particularly like one episode in which Sir Humphrey is pointing out that a British democracy exists solely to keep the important things in life out of the hands of ordinary people such as Radio 3, the countryside, the Royal Opera House, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmOvEwtDycs&amp;amp;t=2m29s&quot;&gt;the universities; both of them&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmOvEwtDycs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-play-the-king&quot;&gt;To Play The King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, House of Cards is one of the best series to come out of the UK. Whilst the US version is also incredibly good, nothing compares to the asides that Ian Richardson does to camera throughout&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fu&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I think the second of the trilogy, “To Play The King”, is best with Urquhart pitted against a new King (played by Michael Kitchen) who is not pleased with the old-fashioned Tory values of the PM. Probably the most true-to-life portrayal of the Conservative Party during the late 80s, early 90s. Just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKhL1pQceHw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;absolute-power&quot;&gt;Absolute Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon “Absolute Power” completely by chance when browsing iTunes a few years ago. Only 2 series were made but they feature Stephen Fry and Martin Bird as the heads of a London PR agency. In my favourite episode, “Tory Women”, Fry performs a makeover on a female Conservative shadow minister (played by Rebecca Front who went on to be the minister in season 3 of “The Thick of It”) and comes up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babNH28wgsA&amp;amp;t=6m21s&quot;&gt;the following immortal line&lt;/a&gt; about Neil Kinnock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If the British public were forced at gunpoint to appoint a new Prime Minister and they could only choose between Jeffrey Archer and Neil Kinnock, who would they pick do you think? A convicted crook and mythomaniac or a sincere and dedicated socialist? They’d choose Archer every time, and why? Because Kinnock is Kinnock and there’s something about that poor bastard that makes you just want to run shrieking from the room. And you’re the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/babNH28wgsA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-statesman&quot;&gt;The New Statesman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the success of “The Young Ones”, Rik Mayall wanted to do something which was more “grown up” and eventually persuaded ITV to produce “The New Statesman”. Whilst I don’t think you could really call it “grown up”, it’s certainly a hilarious alternative view on Conservative MPs. Mayall plays “Alan B’stard”, a Tory MP with the largest majority in the House of Commons. There’s innuendo, slapstick violence, and an awful lot of truth in this series. My favourite episode&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:stormtrooper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:stormtrooper&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; features both Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in an excellent scene in a restaurant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cz1rhLnCrJQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ballot-monkeys&quot;&gt;Ballot Monkeys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest item to my list, “Ballot Monkeys” is an ambitious programme being aired this year on Channel 4. It was advertised as being “so topical we haven’t written it yet” and that is certainly true - each episode is produced on the day it airs with the plots (such as they are) being directly influenced by the news events of the day. The first two episodes aired a week apart but it is now on every night until election night. The series follows each of the 4 main parties in this election (Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem, and UKIP) on their respective “Battle Buses” with both candidates and media advisors discussing the topics of the day. It’s already led to some of the funniest political comedy I’ve seen in years with the Lib Dems desperately searching through a paper for any mention of themselves&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:libdem&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:libdem&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Labour social media campaigner creating fake tweets from “Milifans”, and the UKIP candidate who doesn’t trust their new bus driver&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:terrorist&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:terrorist&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yexneLKGous&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:factory&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb25pO04yls&amp;amp;t=15m30s&quot;&gt;I love this bloody factory&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:factory&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fu&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Did you enjoy my little speech? I thought my “deep personal wound” was a rather good touch. I am in fact extremely angry with His Majesty and I intend to do him harm. I feel exhilarated. Prospect of a fight, of course, with the odds unfairly weighted in my favour. Next to a small war, there’s nothing quite like a general election to stiffen the sinews and summon up the blood.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fu&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:stormtrooper&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I can’t fail to love an episode with the lines “we’re Thatcher’s stormtroopers and we’re in a hurry” or “indeed I do remember the Falklands, made a fortune!” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:stormtrooper&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:libdem&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And a brilliant comparison to a Grand National horse that “didn’t win, but came in the top 4 with odds of 300-1… only slightly better than our odds” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:libdem&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:terrorist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Terrorists eat biscuits too” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:terrorist&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Correct Way To Watch Star Wars</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/04/the-correct-way-to-watch-star-wars/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/04/the-correct-way-to-watch-star-wars/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;May 4th has got a bit out of hand now that it seems to be celebrated as an actual holiday every year. That said, I do like to watch Star Wars fairly regularly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:regularly&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:regularly&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and so I often get a Tatooine style yearning at this time. However, the question that used to always pop up was “which order do you watch them in”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:prequel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:prequel&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It used to be that I’d do the old “IV, V, VI, I, II, III” sequence but that was until I learned about the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/&quot;&gt;Machete Order&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next time you want to introduce someone to Star Wars for the first time, watch the films with them in this order: IV, V, II, III, VI&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Notice something? Yeah, Episode I is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;(http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/)&quot;&gt;full post&lt;/a&gt; explains it more thoroughly (along with benefits and drawbacks) but the basic idea is that you treat episodes II and III as flashbacks whilst The Phantom Menace is relegated to being an “expanded universe” kind of deal similar to The Clone Wars animated series or video games like The Force Unleashed. I’ve watched the films in this order a couple of times now and it really does work a lot better. It also works great if you are introducing the films to someone for the first time (i.e. kids).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m probably not going to watch them this year, but if you do, give the Machete Order a try. You won’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:regularly&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe not annually like I do with Lord of the Rings, but at least every two years. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:regularly&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:prequel&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is no question of not watching the prequel trilogy. I’m just going to go out and say it; Episode II is amazing (especially if you are a politics geek like me). So there. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:prequel&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Great British Bee Count iPhone App</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/01/great-british-bee-count-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/05/01/great-british-bee-count-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that another app I worked on earlier this year has gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/great-british-bee-count/id880987608?mt=8&quot;&gt;Great British Bee Count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/gbbc.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great British Bee Count is a cause started by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foe.co.uk/page/join-great-british-bee-count-today&quot;&gt;Friends of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; which invites the public to help monitor the British bee population. To do this, you can download the free app and then choose to log individual types of bee that you see or, new for this year, perform a timed count which invites you to count as many bees as you can (regardless of type) within 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to update the existing app by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twothirdswater.co.uk&quot;&gt;Two Thirds Water&lt;/a&gt; - I decided it would be quicker to rebuild the app from scratch in Swift rather than try and update what existed previously. This allowed me to easily use several new technologies such as AutoLayout which let me render the pixel-perfect design on all four sizes of iPhone. In addition, I built an offline caching mechanism so you can perform your counts without an internet connection - once a connection is re-established, the counts will be uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project to work on and I think the end result works really well. You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/great-british-bee-count/id880987608?mt=8&quot;&gt;Great British Bee Count on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (it’s free) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foe.co.uk/page/join-great-british-bee-count-today&quot;&gt;learn more about the bee cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Initial thoughts on Apple Watch</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/04/25/initial-thoughts-on-apple-watch/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/04/25/initial-thoughts-on-apple-watch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a bit of hassle with the delivery company&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:delivery&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:delivery&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I was lucky enough to get my Apple Watch yesterday. A few people have asked for my opinions so I’ve jotted down a few rough observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s small. Surprisingly so (especially when compared to other smart watches). I went for the 42mm Apple Watch (Stainless Steel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:steel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:steel&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and it feels incredibly comfortable. It probably could have been 44mm or more and still feel comfortable. It isn’t bulky, heavy, or thick. Of course this is just my own aesthetic opinion and your mileage may vary - the “try on” appointments are a great way to see them up close before ordering. I also like the detail that has gone into it. For example, my watch came with a white sport band but what I hadn’t realised is that the band has the same stainless steel for the pin as the watch body. If you buy the band separately, it is aluminium like the sport watch. One other thing: the box that it came in was incredible and really made it feel like this was a special product. I won’t post pictures as I’m sure there are thousands of unboxing videos online but the steel watches come in a big cube - the sport watches, in contrast, come in a flat oblong box which is probably the reason for the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/123_NeE-ad/&quot;&gt;spring-loaded UK plug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main use case is notifications. I’ve already had several instances where a small nudge has allowed me to see and dismiss a notification in 2 seconds or so.  I typically have my phone on silent with no vibration&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:vibration&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:vibration&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which means I frequently have to get my phone out of my pocket to check the screen and see if I’ve missed anything. This has become even more important now my wife is doing shift work in the evenings as she texts me when she needs me to come collect her from work - I frequently miss these texts! With the watch, I get a subtle nudge&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sounds&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sounds&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and when I raise my wrist it shows me what type of notification it is: iMessage, Facebook, Mail, etc. At that point, if I’m not bothered I can lower my wrist and it’ll go but if I keep it raised a half second longer then it shows me more detail (generally the content of the message). Today whilst I was washing up I got a breaking news notification from the BBC, an “it’s about to rain” notification from Dark Sky, an email from my mum, and a few likes on Instagram. The only time I had to stop what I was doing was when I tapped on my wrist to read the email in full as that was the only thing I wanted to read right then. Had that been my phone buzzing on the table, I probably would have stopped and started several times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps are a bit pants. I didn’t have high expectations for 3rd party apps as they are really just glorified extensions. They are better than I thought but can be quite slow to load sometimes and generally I could have done whatever I needed to do quicker on my phone by that point. For example, Philips has a Hue app which lets me turn my lights on / off around the house and change the colors. However, it’s an app rather than a glance so you have to go to the home screen, tap on the icon, wait (a while) for it to load, and then finally choose from the options. The issue is that is is slower than using the “today widget” they have for notification center on my iPhone which I can access from the lock screen (and the iOS widget is more useful as one tap turns a scene on and another turns it off - the Watch app only does “on”). These are things that will improve and some of the glances are pretty good for an overview but this isn’t a native app experience. It’s very much iOS 1.0 with the HTML “apps” than the App Store we have now&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:unfair&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:unfair&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some 3rd party apps aren’t there. The thing I’ve found most surprising is that there are many big name apps which simply aren’t there at launch, most notably (for me) are Facebook and WhatsApp. This means when you get a notification from these services, you can read the text (same as an iOS push notification) but you can’t reply from the watch or do anything at all. Bearing in mind there are over 3000 apps at launch, I’m very surprised that these two aren’t there. As above, this is something that will improve over time but it is frustrating getting a “someone commented on your photo” notification and not being able to read it. This is a tad hypocritical as I’ve publicly said we’re not doing an app extension for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wallabee&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wallabee&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but then Facebook has a lot more money and developers than me…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some 1st party&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:secondparty&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:secondparty&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; apps aren’t there. Much has been made of the lack of a web browser&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:luke&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:luke&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the thing that really surprises me is the lack of the reminders app. One of the use cases I had for the watch was grocery shopping lists. When my wife goes to the gym I typically drop her off and go and do the weekly grocery shop - we have family sharing enabled so recently we’ve been using reminders so she can add things to the list and I can see it whilst shopping. However, holding an iPhone 6 Plus in one hand and pushing a full trolley is actually quite hard whilst you’re looking for a specific type of quinoa seed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:problems&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:problems&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence I thought that the watch would be great as I’d be able to see our list and cross things off as I grab them. It isn’t to be though as there is no reminders app - you can set reminders via Siri and you get the notifications but you can’t just view your reminders and tick them off in a list. There are 3rd party apps available (such as the wonderful “&lt;a href=&quot;http://culturedcode.com/things/watch/&quot;&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;”) but then you start having to do jiggery pokery with certain reminder lists being imported and I don’t really want to see 60 items in my to-do list on my desktop. It seems a very odd omission so I’m hopeful that a WatchOS update will see that app added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise. I haven’t done anything other than walking the dogs but from what I’ve seen it works well. I started up the exercise app and chose “outside walk” and it logged my distance, calories burned, heart rate, etc. I’m looking forward to taking it out for a run at some point soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notifications again. I just had to mention “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knocktounlock.com&quot;&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt;”. It’s an app that allows you to unlock your Mac by knocking on your iPhone (by some sort of dark magic as far as I can tell) but it is now updated for Apple Watch. Basically, when I sit at my desk and move my mouse, the computer comes out of standby and shows the lock screen and I get a notification on my wrist - tapping it unlocks the Mac. I have a pretty long password so it is a nice feature but it shows some of the potential of location-aware apps. I’ve always said that the Apple Watch will be like Disney’s MagicBands and this seems to be true when you consider you can use it to unlock doors (and computers) and pay for things (in the US… grrrr). Knock is just one of those “this is cool” moments about the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Pay. Seriously, this needs to come to the UK. We already have all of the NFC hardware so I can’t see what the hold up is. I firmly believe that Apple Pay will become my #1 use case for the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital Touch. I had a chance to play with the digital touch stuff this morning and it works pretty well. The only thing I dislike about it is that you don’t get the taps in real time unless you have the requisite app open; you get a standard notification to say “someone sent you a digital touch message” which when you open then plays it back. I really wanted this to happen without the notification step so my wife could send me some taps and I’d receive them on my wrist without doing anything (so, for instance, she could send 2 taps to say she is ready for me to pick her up). Might as well just send a txt if it is going to require me to look at the watch to open the message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordering process. I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the ordering process and how Apple has screwed everyone over with a 2-week release period and no ability to queue and get one. My assessment is that the watch has been much more popular than they imagined and that gauging which models people would choose is a lot tricker than many give credit for. With the iPhone and iPad, it is fairly easy as you have a choice of storage tiers and, in the case of the iPad, Wi-Fi or Cellular. You can do market research (based on what they’ve sold previously) to work out which ones you need the most of and where. However, with the watch the majority of it is purely aesthetics. How do you get the right split between the different coloured bands or know if people will be willing to pay extra for Stainless Steel, a leather loop band, or a link bracelet? It seems there could be some manufacturing issues as well in that there hasn’t been a single pink band seen in the wild yet (not even in the demo units at Apple Stores) and none of them have shipped. Several of the other bands aren’t shipping yet either - I wanted my watch to come with the black leather loop but that would have meant waiting 4-6 weeks so I went for a white sport band (I ordered the leather loop separately and it could be here next week).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that is pretty much all of my first impressions for the time being. In short, I’m finding it to be a great device for small interactions and for being able to triage incoming notifications when your hands are full. It’s the first step to an incredible wave of products (from all manufacturers) and I think most people will be pleased with it. Just don’t go in expecting the 3rd party apps to be at the level that they are on iOS devices currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:delivery&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s the first time Apple have shipped anything by UK Mail and I hope the last. Whilst it was in the UK well in advance of the dispatch notice, it went out for delivery at 5.40am and then an hour later was listed as “delayed” with a date of 27th April for delivery. I phoned UK Mail and had to wait 2 hours for them to call me back to say that I could come and pick it up from the depot on the Saturday - however, during that time, the status had changed back to delivery for that day. When the driver turned up, he was quite rude and complained about all the people buying Apple products as meant he had to deliver more! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:delivery&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:steel&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I wish there was a better way of saying “the watch that isn’t the sport one or the gold one” - peculiar to name a specific model the same as the whole line. Reminds me of when they went for “the new iPad” rather than “iPad 3” (but at least then you could call it that). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:steel&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:vibration&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reason being is that when I’m working on my computer, I frequently get notifications on both (i.e. from Tweetbot) - I don’t like having my phone vibrating across the desk all the time so I have that switched off. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:vibration&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sounds&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have the sounds on at the moment but I’ll turn them off soon - it’s just for the novelty of being able to say “oh, is that my APPLE WATCH” to people nearby. I’m a bit of a dick like that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sounds&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:unfair&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That might a bit unfair. Some of the apps work well but it is very hit and miss. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:unfair&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:wallabee&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The main reason being that adding more interactivity to the notifications (like the ability to reply to a message) would mean adding an app to the watch. Once you do that, you’re getting into a lot of work. I wish there was a way you could add a custom design to notifications without doing an app (so I could show an image when we release a new item) but again, the only way to do that is to go for a full watch app. The experience of that would be slower than the iPhone so for now it isn’t very compelling for me with my business hat on. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:wallabee&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:secondparty&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Whilst typing this I realise we have a concept of “1st party / 3rd party” and “1st person / 3rd person”. Does “2nd party” or “2nd person” exist? After a bit of googling, the “2nd party” would be “you” (i.e. 1st party is Apple, 2nd party is consumer, 3rd party is developer). There’s a few times a day where little questions like these pop up - Siri on the watch is pretty good for getting quick answers to them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:secondparty&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:luke&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It reminds me of when iBooks launched and it was iPad only. Lots of people asked why it wasn’t on iPhone to which the general consensus was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukeredpath/status/11477537496&quot;&gt;It would be shit&lt;/a&gt;”. Of course, it then did appear on iPhone but I don’t think it’ll happen with Safari on the watch. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cufflink-browser/id918254991?mt=8&quot;&gt;3rd party browser&lt;/a&gt; available already though. It looks shit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:luke&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:problems&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;First world problems, right? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:problems&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Developer pre-orders</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/04/24/developer-preorders/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/04/24/developer-preorders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m often asked if Apple let me pre-order devices earlier than consumers or if they give me a discount. The answer is always “no”; to Apple, developers are just normal consumers. We may get access to SDKs and beta OS releases in advance&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:advance&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:advance&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but with hardware we have to pre-order with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a slight exception has recently been made for the Apple Watch. On a random basis, Apple have allowed developers to register their interest to get an Apple Watch Sport (with blue band) and then out of those that applied they’ve randomly selected a few to actually purchase them (with guaranteed dispatch by the 28th April). Whilst I think this is a great idea, there are several problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) This was only offered a few days before the release of the Apple Watch and over a week after pre-orders had gone live (and sold out spectacularly). If you are going to offer hardware to developers, it would be better to do it in advance of the pre-order or at the same time so that they don’t try and purchase their own if they are only buying for development purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) This offer was completely random. I didn’t receive an email and neither did several other developers I know who would have liked to. At first I thought this might be because I’d already made a purchase but that was actually with a different Apple ID&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:multiple&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:multiple&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, other developers I know that had already ordered devices were given the chance to register for this lottery. This brings me to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) There seems to be nothing in place to stop developers who already had pre-ordered from getting in on this deal and then selling the watch at a high-rate on eBay. A quick search on Twitter will show plenty of developers doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this could have been done in a much better way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Email developers a week prior to pre-orders to let them know that they have the opportunity to skip the queue. Take their payments upfront (to make sure they are serious and to avoid issues later) and then randomly choose those that were successful before pre-orders go live in a similar way to how WWDC tickets were allocated this year. By doing this, those that aren’t successful can still get in the regular queue with everybody else and nobody misses out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Lock the hardware to the developer account so that it can’t be resold (perhaps limited to 1 year). This would prevent developers taking advantage of the deal to enrich themselves in the grey market. The technology for this already exists bearing in mind that hardware can be locked to an Apple ID (so it can’t be resold if stolen) so it shouldn’t be too tricky for Apple to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think offering these pre-order deals for developers is a great way to help them write apps for the platform (and ensure compatability in an ever growing ecosystem) but the ability for people to make a quick buck and the total randomness of who gets invited to the lottery leaves a sour taste. I was lucky enough to be able to get the watch I wanted delivered on launch day but there are several developers who have weeks of waiting whilst others with several placed orders are able to get a special offer that’ll go on eBay. Its a first step, but hopefully Apple can do better for future hardware releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:advance&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although not always enough - for instance, there was 9 days to get apps compatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and realistically you’re going to be in the review queue for 80-90% of that time… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:advance&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:multiple&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have my personal Apple ID along with two development account Apple IDs, neither of which were contacted about this offer. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:multiple&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve just pushed out a big update to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;iTunes Artwork Finder&lt;/a&gt; today that allows you to view the following information about apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screenshots for Apple Watch, iPad, and iPhone (in all 4 sizes: 3.5”, 4”, 4.7”, and 5.5”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video previews, where applicable, for iPad and iPhone (again, in all 4 sizes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check it out, simply search for an app in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;iTunes Artwork Finder&lt;/a&gt; and then click on the “view screenshots / videos” link that will appear above the app icon. This will take you to a new page I’ve created which outputs all of the screenshots and videos available for that app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick look at a few more of the interesting ones as we reach the Apple Watch launch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>LOLy 2.0</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/03/25/loly-v2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 09:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/03/25/loly-v2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that an app I worked on late last year has finally gone live on the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loly/id893477100?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;LOLy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/loly-v2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOLy is an app that allows you to send stylish and beautifully designed large emoji, many of which are animated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to work on the v2 app update as the previous app suffered from a few performance issues and there were requirements for new functionality. I completely rebuilt the app from the ground up using Swift along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://realm.io&quot;&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt; as a super-fast local database. The app is now super-smooth and images, even animated ones, appear instantly. I also used AutoLayout to ensure that the app looked great on all 4 sizes of iPhone from the tiny iPhone 4S to the massive iPhone 6 Plus. I came up with a lot of the UX changes and integrated iCloud to enable syncing of favourites. Remember that blog post I did about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/12/10/skproduct-localized-price-in-swift/&quot;&gt;localising prices in Swift&lt;/a&gt;? That was also for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the big thing with this update isn’t just the speed and performance boosts but the headline new feature: an iOS 8 keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/loly-keyboard.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a real challenge and I came across design issues, the technical constraints of the iOS 8 keyboards, and various requirements from the App Store review team. With design, it was important to make the keyboard match the app as much as possible and to try and show as many of these stickers as possible whilst also syncing “recently used” and “favourites” with the parent app. The technical constraints were far harder. There is only a limited amount of memory available to these extensions so trying to show animated images along with the fairly complex design was tricky. Add in the general problem of image-based keyboards requiring full keyboard access (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/07/the-problem-with-allow-full-access-on-ios8-keyboards/&quot;&gt;which I’ve discussed before&lt;/a&gt;) and being limited to copy/paste for inserting images into apps and it became trickier than expected! Finally, the App Store insisted that the keyboard also contain a full text keyboard and numeric keyboard which had to be added fairly late on. Despite all this, he keyboard looks and works great. I’ve been using it a lot over the past few months and it really is a great way for sending a message with more playfulness than the stock emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, I also built an online admin system so that the packs can be updated, added to, or re-ordered remotely without going through the App Store review process. This is all pushed via an innovative patch system I designed which allows for delta updates to keep bandwidth costs to a minimum both for users and the clients servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had great fun working on this app and I’m really proud of the result. You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loly/id893477100?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;LOLy on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; - it’s a free app with lots of stickers but, at the time of writing, you can download additional packs for $0.99/£0.79.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing "Blind Bags"</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/23/introducing-blind-bags/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/23/introducing-blind-bags/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was little, I’ve loved collecting. As far as I can remember, the first thing I collected seriously was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogo&#39;s_Crazy_Bones&quot;&gt;Gogo’s Crazy Bones&lt;/a&gt; when I was at school in the 90s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:although&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:although&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They came in blind bags so the first couple of times you bought them you’d get all new stuff but then, as your collection got more complete, the chances of getting something you already owned increased. This mode of selling seems to have really caught on over the past few years and I find myself collecting a number of things that work this way, primarily &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinity.disney.com/en-gb/power-discs&quot;&gt;Disney Infinity Power Discs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com/en-gb/minifigures/&quot;&gt;LEGO Minifigures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst trying to sort through my Disney Infinity collection last week, I did a quick search on the App Store and found only one app that hadn’t been updated for a while and was a bit basic. After having several weeks away from coding whilst being on jury duty, I thought it might be fun to get back into the swing of things over the weekend by building a basic prototype app to solve my collecting need but also pick up a few new skills along the way. Thus, “Blind Bags” was born:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/blindbags-promo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is fairly basic in that it lists all of the series of power discs available and then lets you tap through to see a list view showing which ones you own and which ones you don’t (as denoted by whether they are slightly-transparent or not). You can hold your finger down on a disc to change its state making for a quick way of logging new additions to the collection. If you tap on an item, you go through to a bigger detail view which gives you a bit of description text and allows you to enter a number of spares if applicable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/blindbags-detail.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spares piece is particularly important as you can then build up a list of which items you have spares of and how many:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/blindbags-spares.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, everything is synced online which allows me to generate a basic page showing which discs I’m missing and which discs I have available to trade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blindba.gs/users/bendodson&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/blindbags-site.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best bit of all of this is that the entire project took just 4 hours&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:timewasting&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:timewasting&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; thanks to using &lt;a href=&quot;https://parse.com&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to get their SDK integrated quickly into a new app (using Swift 1.2) and begin prototyping within 20 minutes which is pretty cool as I’ve never used it before. From there, it was a simple case of building some basic UICollectionViews and some CRUD functionality. Parse also has a PHP SDK so within a few minutes I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blindba.gs/users/bendodson/&quot;&gt;a basic page&lt;/a&gt; which allowed me to output the data that the app was saving. Whilst there is no fallback for loss of connection, etc, at the moment (this is just a prototype after all) these are all things that could be added fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step was to get a domain name&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:obviously&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:obviously&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and purchase a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/item/hype-app-landing-page/6671565&quot;&gt;site template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:template&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:template&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to build a basic landing page showing off a few screenshots of the app and giving anybody interested the chance to register their email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment the app is solely geared towards one thing for one user but it could easily be expanded outwards into a full service for other collectors to use. Using Parse and a cheap site template, I’ve been able to get a prototype app up and running and a decent landing page in just 4 hours. If there is enough interest, I think 2 days of work is all that is needed to migrate the database to a different hosting solution&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:parse&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:parse&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and release it as a full app most likely using a subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://blindba.gs&quot;&gt;the Blind Bags site&lt;/a&gt; and add your email address to get notified as more details become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:although&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although, now I think of it, I also collected &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogs&quot;&gt;Pogs&lt;/a&gt; and (believe it or not) Panini Football Stickers! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:although&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:timewasting&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of which at least 1 hour was choosing a font. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:timewasting&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:obviously&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously I had to go for one in a similar pattern to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee&quot;&gt;wallab.ee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pouchcreatur.es&quot;&gt;pouchcreatur.es&lt;/a&gt; and settled for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blindba.gs&quot;&gt;blindba.gs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:obviously&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:template&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Seriously, templates make this so much easier. I’ve not done any serious HTML work in years and I can’t be bothered getting things working on mobile let alone Internet Explorer. For just $13, I was able to get a fully responsive template full of animations along with the original PSDs so I could quickly integrate promo shots. The site was up and running in under an hour with the majority of that time being me writing copy and choosing the right screenshots. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:template&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:parse&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think Parse is great for prototyping but I wouldn’t use it for a live app - for one thing the relational database just isn’t powerful enough for the kind of queries I’d like to do. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:parse&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Three years of WallaBee</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/16/3-years-of-wallabee/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/16/3-years-of-wallabee/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m celebrating three years since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; was released into the world. Originally conceived as an extension to the item collecting side of Gowalla, it launched in February 2012 as a completely standalone game with beautiful artwork and a very dedicated group of players. Since then it has won awards and grown far beyond what I originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t been an easy (or cheap&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:cheap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:cheap&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) journey, but today we have a large player base and we’ve stuck to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/02/16/ive-been-looking-forward-to-this-day-for-a-long-time/&quot;&gt;principles I laid out&lt;/a&gt; when I first launched the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are focussed on a single thing; items. We have a location database and we allow players and developers to add to this database but it’s not our key focus. We are fundamentally not a check-in service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t just want to build a community of players, we also want to build a community of developers. If you build something on our platform, we’ll promote it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most important thing, the item that is at the core of who we are, is that we are dedicated to the player. We promise to listen, adapt, and make changes that the community wants rather than just blazing our own trail. We will never fundamentally change our product on a whim when we know that it’s not what our community wants. We built this app because it’s the app we wanted to use. We will never deviate from that course or that core belief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is just one thing I could choose about WallaBee that I’m proud of, it would be that we stuck to those initial promises. We haven’t taken any external funding nor done things simply to boost user numbers or revenue. Every decision we make is based on a simple philosophy: &lt;em&gt;do we like it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, we’re going to be launching a lot of new things which will grow WallaBee from one game to a global brand. Even so, we won’t change from those core beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:cheap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For anybody wondering about the financials of such a game, you need at least $30000 to get started and you will lose a lot of money for the first 18 months (great artists and servers are both expensive and necessary). I started WallaBee on the basis that if it wasn’t break even by year 2 then we’d shut it down. Happily, we’ve been turning a profit since September 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:cheap&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>IAP and icons in the 'Featured' section of the App Store</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/12/iap-icons-featured-app-store/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2015 18:15:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/02/12/iap-icons-featured-app-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple did something slightly different with their weekly update of the &lt;em&gt;Featured&lt;/em&gt; section of the App Store today that is bound to get people talking: they singled out Apps without In-App Purchases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-pay-once.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pay Once and Play on the App Store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contains a number of great games that have no IAP within them. Unfortunately this section is hidden by the first few slides in the top banner the most prominent of which is for King of Thieves, a new freemium game by ZeptoLab (of Cut The Rope fame):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-king.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;King of Thieves on the App Store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find particularly distasteful about this is that it is a timer-filled game in which the top IAP costs £40&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:topiap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:topiap&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and is obviously the complete opposite of what Apple are trying to achieve with the above campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I noticed some other interesting editorial decisions this week all based in the &lt;em&gt;What’s New&lt;/em&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-abc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ABC App Icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or does that say A B C?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7 App Icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two apps placed next to each other using a number 7 for their icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;M App Icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two apps placed next to each other using an M in a circle for their icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/featured-app-store-tick.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tick App Icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two apps placed next to each other using a tick for their icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems strange that with so much choice in the App Store, Apple chose to feature so many apps with similar icons and then place them directly next to each other. I can’t remember the last time I found a truly good app on the front page of the App Store (that wasn’t featured elsewhere beforehand) but I really hope they find a way to improve App Store discovery soon&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:discovery&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:discovery&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:topiap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;~~What is worse is that if you view the King of Thieves app in the App Store, the section called “In-App Purchases” isn’t listed so you can’t see these IAPs until you download the game. With WallaBee, we keep our prices intentionally low and you can see that reflected in that list. I’m not sure why King of Thieves is exempt from this.~~ It looks like this was just a timing issue - as of now, there are two IAPs listed (the cheapest) so I’m assuming that this is simply a “most popular” list that gets slowly populated over time. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:topiap&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:discovery&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On which note, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/12/pinterest-app-pins/&quot;&gt;the App Store joined Pinterest today and added a feature called App Pins&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to install apps without leaving the app - I’m not sure why this is being pitched as a new thing as this kind of modal App Store pane has been available to developers since iOS 7… &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:discovery&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that a book I worked on as a technical reviewer is now available; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/xcode-6-essentials&quot;&gt;Xcode 6 Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by Jayant Varma. The book works as a good overview of Xcode 6 and the Swift language and is suitable for both OS X and iOS developers. My role was to ensure technical accuracy and to make sure that all of the code samples work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2015/xcode-6-essentials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Xcode 6 Essentials&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get it now in both print and eBook formats from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/xcode-6-essentials&quot;&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SKProduct localized price in Swift</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/12/10/skproduct-localized-price-in-swift/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/12/10/skproduct-localized-price-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on a Swift project which uses In App Purchasing (IAP). One of the many pitfalls of IAP is displaying the cost of a product in the correct format; all too often developers use the default US formatting leading to apps showing prices of $0.99 in the UK. Gross!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think you can use the locale of the device to format the number and you’d be correct apart from the user may be using an App Store in a different locale to that of their device (i.e. a UK account but they have their device sent to French if that is their primary language). The SKProduct object that iTunes returns has a locale attached so it is fairly simple to format the price with that in order to get the localized version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StoreKit&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;SKProduct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localizedPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSNumberFormatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numberStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CurrencyStyle&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;priceLocale&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringFromNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is a simple Swift extension (also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/SKProduct-LocalizedPrice-Swift&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) which, if it is in your project, will automatically be available on any SKProduct object (similar to using Categories in Objective-C). If we assume we have an SKProduct called product, we can now run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-swift&quot; data-lang=&quot;swift&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The price of this product is \(product.localizedPrice())&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Example output: The price of this product is £0.69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how many apps either don’t display the price of an IAP in advance or display it in the wrong locale. Don’t let your app be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yosemite WiFi Workaround&#58; Airport Express and USB Ethernet Adapter</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/11/26/yosemite-wifi-airport-express-and-usb-ethernet-adapter/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/11/26/yosemite-wifi-airport-express-and-usb-ethernet-adapter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many people, Yosemite has been a total killer for my WiFi. I finally broke down over the weekend when my WiFI was disconnecting every 10 seconds or so&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ethernet&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ethernet&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2014/11/25/heres-the-root-cause-and-a-workaround-for-ios-8-and-yosemite-wi/&quot;&gt;workaround available&lt;/a&gt; but it requires losing the ability to AirDrop which I use frequently. I’ve eventually fixed it with a long winded solution which I thought I’d share, but first a little backstory…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My WiFi is completely Apple-centric. I have an Airport Extreme (the newest 802.11ac model) and nothing but Apple computers. There are a couple of Apple TVs in the house and a few Airport Express’ for AirPlaying music. A little while ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/17/issues-with-airport-express-airport-extreme-and-yosemite/&quot;&gt;I detailed how Yosemite was erroneously connecting through an Airport Express&lt;/a&gt; causing serious slowdown; the solution I had at that time was to separate my WiFi into 5GHz and 2.4GHz channels (with all AirPlay on 2.4 and all devices on 5). That was the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve had to revert to doing this for my work computer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://playground.bendodson.com/airport-lan-yosemite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fixing Yosemite with an Airport Express and USB Ethernet cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, I’ve had to plug in a USB Ethernet adapter and use a LAN cable to an Airport Express operating as a wireless bridge! As far as Yosemite is concerned, that’s a LAN connection and so it doesn’t drop out continuously. Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one issue though; that Apple USB Ethernet adapter (which they &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MC704ZM/A/apple-usb-ethernet-adapter&quot;&gt;still sell&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t work in Mavericks yet alone Yosemite. To fix it, you need to download the drivers for the chip it is built on (helpfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php?sub=driverdetail&amp;amp;PItemID=136&quot;&gt;available from ASIX&lt;/a&gt;), restart Yosemite, then manually add a USB Ethernet connection within Network in System Settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all working like a charm, complete with full AirDrop support and no dropped connections. My new Retina iMac is coming today&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:outfordelivery&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:outfordelivery&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I’m hoping that it having an 802.11ac chip will forgoe the need for this ridiculous workaround. At the very least I’ll be able to leave out the ethernet adapter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:ethernet&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I buy a house rather than rent, the first thing going in will be a gigabit LAN throughout. WiFi isn’t good enough for a media server and work machine. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:ethernet&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:outfordelivery&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Out For Delivery”. Feels like I’ve been waiting forever! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:outfordelivery&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Dishwasher tablets and app competition</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/11/18/dishwasher-tablets-and-app-competition/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/11/18/dishwasher-tablets-and-app-competition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I bought some new dishwasher tablets online that happened to be on offer. When they arrived, their packaging had a banner at the top saying &lt;em&gt;‘switch &amp;amp; see the difference’&lt;/em&gt; which got me thinking about app competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed it today when I loaded the dishwasher after breakfast. Where I usually rinse the plates, I instead put them straight in so I could test if these tablets really were any better. When I unloaded the dishes and found them not as clean as usual, I immediately thought not to buy those tablets again. The strange thing about the above is that it was a totally subconcious decision both to forgo rinsing and to blame the new tablets rather than my change of habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to app competition as it shows something which is hardwired in us; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a competitor must be much better in order to affect a change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If your app is competing by having the same features or slightly more features, that might not be enough to make your competitors customers switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at competitors for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, the main one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.facebook.com/packrat/&quot;&gt;PackRat&lt;/a&gt;, a collecting game that runs on Facebook. Whilst we have better artwork and features, it is still a struggle to make people switch as there isn’t necessarily a killer reason for them to make that switch. That’s the task I’m focussing on now. I need to go that extra mile to get players to change to my game; I need to wash their non-rinsed plates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speeding up your DNS</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/20/speeding-up-your-dns/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/20/speeding-up-your-dns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/17/issues-with-airport-express-airport-extreme-and-yosemite/&quot;&gt;post last week&lt;/a&gt; about speeding up my home network, I noticed that my connection has still been quite slow when viewing websites. I have a steady 72Mbps down / 19Mbps up connection so that wasn’t the issue which narrowed it down to being either something wrong with my laptop or my DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I found a great little app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/namebench/&quot;&gt;namebench&lt;/a&gt; which searches through all kinds of DNS providers to find you the best speed. It was created by some Google engineers during their 20% time and works on OS X, Windows, and Linux. I usually use it as soon as I get a new machine but I’d forgotten to run it following my update to Yosemite which involved a fresh install. As it turns out, my home BT DNS is terrible and namebench managed to find some BT DNS servers that were 245% faster! Now my browser is flying along and it feels like I have a totally new connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d thoroughly recommend giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/namebench/&quot;&gt;namebench&lt;/a&gt; a try - it’s totally free and takes around 15 minutes but you may end up with a much faster connection at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Issues with Airport Express, Airport Extreme, and OS X Yosemite</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/17/issues-with-airport-express-airport-extreme-and-yosemite/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2014 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/17/issues-with-airport-express-airport-extreme-and-yosemite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally fixed a problem today that has been plaguing me for the past couple of weeks. For some reason, my MacBook Pro was getting a pitiful internet speed (around 1Mbps on an 80Mbps connection). Sometimes restarting my Airport Extreme router would fix the problem but it would slow down to a crawl a few minutes later. If I moved downstairs (near the router), then suddenly the speed would be much more acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending some time looking at my wireless network settings, I realised I was connecting to an 802.11n network. This is odd as I have a new 802.11ac Airport Extreme. It turns out the culprit was an Airport Express I put in my bedroom which I use purely for Airplay to a set of speakers. It is one of the newer models that supports 802.11n and it was joined to, but not extending, my wireless network from the Airport Extreme. For some reason, and I’m fairly sure it is a change in Yosemite, my MacBook was connecting to that Airport Express via the 802.11n despite the fact it wasn’t an extended network and it was obviously slower than the 802.11ac router which is only slightly further away. This slashed my connection speed by roughly 90% as everything was routed through the bridged connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I’ve put in place was to give the 5GHz network a different name on my Airport Extreme. I’ve configured all of my Airport Express cards and Apple TVs to connect to the 2.4GHz network and all my regular devices connect to the 5GHz. There is now no danger of my MacBook accidentally connecting to an extended network but AirPlay still works like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice you’ve got a slower connection since upgrading to Yosemite, it might be worth taking a look if any AirPlay devices are to blame!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>October LEGO Updates</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/16/october-lego-updates/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/16/october-lego-updates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to write a couple of LEGO updates this month as there is so much cool stuff being unveiled. In the end I decided to do it as one big post…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slave-i&quot;&gt;Slave I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video was released from the LEGO Design team showing off the latest UCS Star Wars set coming in January; Boba Fett’s iconic ship &lt;em&gt;Slave I&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/pIO8Ne0CfkU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like an absolutely fantastic set with a lot of cool features, the standard UCS stand, and (best of all) a Han Solo frozen in Carbonite!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hansolo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:hansolo&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Slave I is showing on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Slave-I-75060?_requestid=1003713&quot;&gt;LEGO Website&lt;/a&gt; as being available on 1st Jan 2015 and consists of 1996 pieces. UCS sets like this are usually made available to VIP members a couple of weeks before but I’m not sure if that will happen with it being Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Christmas…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;christmas-lego&quot;&gt;Christmas LEGO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Christmas&quot;&gt;LEGO Christmas sets&lt;/a&gt; are now available including &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Santa-s-Workshop-10245&quot;&gt;Santa’s Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout October there are double points for VIP members and if you spend over £50 you get an exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-Free-Gift&quot;&gt;Toy Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. I’m quite tempted by the workshop and a few baubles for the tree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/lego-santa-workshop.png&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Santa&#39;s Workshop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hobbit&quot;&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today saw the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/The-Hobbit-ByTheme?ShipTo=GB&amp;amp;_requestid=1005201&quot;&gt;4 new sets in ‘The Hobbit’ series&lt;/a&gt;. These range from the small Witch-king Battle to the largest Hobbit set yet with The Lonely Mountain (complete with Smaug). As with the previous 5 sets, there is something about these I’m just not keen on. I loved the Lord of the Rings sets so much that I bought all of them but there’s something about The Hobbit which doesn’t grab me in the same way. The Lonely Mountain set is also very expensive (most likely to cover the cost of Smaug) at £99.99 for less than 900 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/lego-lonely-mountain.png&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO The Hobbit: The Lonely Mountain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jurassic-park-world&quot;&gt;Jurassic (Park) World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more exciting announcements last week is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualpressoffice.com/publicsiteContentFileAccess?fileContentId=1768292&amp;amp;fromOtherPageToDisableHistory=Y&amp;amp;menuName=News&amp;amp;sId=&amp;amp;sInfo=&quot;&gt;Universal have confirmed&lt;/a&gt; LEGO will be a licensing partner for Jurassic World, the new Jurassic Park movie due next year. When I collected the LEGO Dino series a few years ago, I thought it would be much better as a licensed Jurassic Park set and it seems that dream has come true. I’m hoping this will go hand in hand with a Jurassic Park LEGO game from Telltale with all 4 films. If the sets go down well, I’m fairly sure they’ll do some of the classic scenes from the original 3 films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blocks-magazine&quot;&gt;Blocks Magazine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Blocks magazine (which I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/12/blocks-magazine/&quot;&gt;raved about before&lt;/a&gt;) becomes a monthly magazine starting next week. If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blocksmag.com&quot;&gt;order an annual subscription&lt;/a&gt;, they’re sending out a really cool minifigure of the editor complete with a tiny pilot issue of the magazine. Mine arrived today and I can’t wait for the magazine to come next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/blocks-minifig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blocks Magazine Subscription Limited Edition Minifigure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That pretty much sums up the exciting LEGO announcements so far this month. My LEGO room still in the process of being setup after moving house and I have these sets to finish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/The-Tumbler-76023&quot;&gt;The Tumbler&lt;/a&gt; (⅓rd built!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Sandcrawler-75059&quot;&gt;Sandcrawler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Rancor-Pit-75005&quot;&gt;Rancor Pit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike-75040&quot;&gt;General Grievous’ Wheel Bike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Battle-at-the-Black-Gate-79007&quot;&gt;Battle at the Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:hansolo&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was originally in 9516 Jabba’s Palace and almost tempted me into buying that incredibly overpriced set (I’m glad I didn’t in the end) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:hansolo&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>‘No results found’ on iTunes Artwork Finder</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/10/no-results-found-on-itunes-artwork-finder/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 16:30:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/10/no-results-found-on-itunes-artwork-finder/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;iTunes Artwork Finder&lt;/a&gt; has proven very popular over the last couple of years. The issue with popularity is that the amount of correspondence increases. In the past two years, the top requests via email have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a specific country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asking for artwork of a specific show or film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed the first a little while ago by automatically listing all of the iTunes countries but the second continues to be a constant issue in my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the finder works is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html&quot;&gt;iTunes Search API&lt;/a&gt; to find the item you are interested in and then retrieve the artwork. This basically means that if the item isn’t on iTunes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:itunesunavailable&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:itunesunavailable&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, this tool won’t find the artwork for you. If you email me asking for a specific show or movie cover, I can’t help you.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:itunesartwork&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:itunesartwork&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and limit the amount of email I get like this, I put in a disclaimer on the website. This got buried at the bottom of the page when I had a redesign so now I’ve added a note within the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/itunes-artwork-finder-no-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;No results found&amp;quot; on iTunes Artwork Finder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that should work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:itunesunavailable&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It might that a film hasn’t been released yet, the TV show is only on Netflix, or there is some other reason why iTunes doesn’t stock the film, show, or album you are looking for. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:itunesunavailable&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:itunesartwork&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I will generally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/subler/&quot;&gt;Subler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/imghp?gws_rd=ssl&quot;&gt;Google Image Search&lt;/a&gt; if the iTunes Artwork Finder comes up blank. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:itunesartwork&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had a desire to change the stock keyboard on iOS. When the announcement was made at WWDC 2014, I thought that it was an interesting feature, but not one I would ever want to use. That changed when I saw the teaser page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://popkey.co&quot;&gt;PopKey&lt;/a&gt;, a keyboard that allowed you to paste animated GIFs straight into your conversations. That made me think about keyboards in a different way and how developers might create interesting keyboards that aren’t just improved ways of typing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:swype&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:swype&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, PopKey isn’t very good. It doesn’t have search, watermarks the images, requires you to create an account and give over your phone number, and it was beaten by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riffsy.com&quot;&gt;Riffsy&lt;/a&gt; which is actually better&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:riffsy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:riffsy&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the problem I’ve seen over and over again is that these keyboards require “Full Access”. This is a feature that basically enables the keyboard to talk to its host app and to the internet. The reason you might want this for a keyboard is that it might do auto-correct (iOS 8 keyboards do not have access to the Apple auto-correct algorithms) and therefore does some processing in an app or in the cloud. With Riffsy and PopKey, this is obviously required in order that it can download the GIFs from the internet. The real issue isn’t that it requires this access, but that Apple puts up this message when you enable it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/full-access-keyboard-ios8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allow Full Access dialogue on iOS 8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This could include sensitive information such as your credit card number or street address” - could they make that sound any scarier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen numerous people tweeting at PopKey asking them why it requires this access and how they won’t use the app until that requirement is turned off (which obviously won’t work - it &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; internet access). I engaged a few in conversation and, even after I explained how it worked, the message I got back was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bigperrydog/status/517340559736729600&quot;&gt;I don’t trust it&lt;/a&gt;”. I’ve even chatted to a few iOS developers who refuse to install a GIF keyboard because of that warning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic problem is that the alert message you see is almost too scary and doesn’t give enough information. It was obviously written for what Apple expected; text keyboards. I’m not sure of a complete solution but as a start it needs to make it clearer that only things you type in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; keyboard can be (potentially) seen by the developer. You don’t type anything in a GIF keyboard so the developers, if they are logging everything, can only see what stupid images you are sending. In addition, 3rd party apps can block custom keyboards from showing on sensitive screens (i.e. when entering your master password in 1Password or entering your pin in a banking app) and password fields automatically disable 3rd party apps (try it in Safari to see).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is developers that will suffer for this. End users are already up in arms about privacy and demanding keyboards not use this feature whilst clients don’t necessarily understand what is going on and just see the negative feedback. I’ve been approached by a number of prospective clients to build these keyboards and so far I’ve put them off by showing them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=full%20keyboard%20access&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Full Keyboard Access’&lt;/em&gt; search on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fka&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fka&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me to that Apple are treating the keyboard as a power feature and expect people to understand how it works under the hood. Seeing as some security savvy developers are cautious about installing these things, I think Apple has a lot of improvements to make in the way keyboards are installed, especially if it is to avoid negative fallout from end users who think that developers can steal your credit card number with an emoji keyboard. It’s good to be cautious about these things, but at the moment people are completely paranoid due to the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:swype&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That is if you call swiping an improvement. Sidenote: I hate that since iOS 8 a lot of people misspell the verb ‘swipe’ as ‘swype’ (as in “I can’t swype through this page in your app”) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:swype&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:riffsy&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It irritates me that PopKey is the more well known keyboard though. This is entirely due to the fact that it put up a really nicely designed teaser page in advance and has got a lot of press coverage. I think it is really bad they still use the tagline “The world’s first animated GIF keyboard” when it clearly wasn’t and has so many flaws compared to the app that came first. That it is featured by Apple in the Best New Apps section is a great shame. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:riffsy&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:fka&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For a while I tried to educate people as to how a GIF keyboard can’t read your iMessages. I gave up after a while. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:fka&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Showing TODO as a warning in a Swift Xcode project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely use comments when I’m coding&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:comments&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:comments&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I do make one exception though; using &lt;code&gt;// TODO:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;// FIXME:&lt;/code&gt; to highlight pieces of code I need to revisit at a later date. The advantage of doing this is that the lines then show up in the jump bar popover in bold text with one-click access to the exact line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/todo-jump-bar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TODO comments in the Xcode jump bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue I have with this is that it is very easy to forget about them unless you are using the jump bar frequently. I used to log them in my todo manager, &lt;a href=&quot;http://culturedcode.com/things/&quot;&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;, but that duplicates the workload. It would be much more useful if those errors were flagged in some way…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreysambells.com/2013/01/31/generate-xcode-warnings-from-todo-comments&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Sambells wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; on how to flag these comments as Xcode warnings but that only applies for Objective-C. With a slight tweak, here is a run script build phase for flagging &lt;code&gt;TODO:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FIXME:&lt;/code&gt; as warnings in a Swift project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TAGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;TODO:|FIXME:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;searching ${SRCROOT} for ${TAGS}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
find &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${SRCROOT}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt; -name &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;*.swift&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\)&lt;/span&gt; -print0 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xargs -0 egrep --with-filename --line-number --only-matching &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;($TAGS).*\$&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; perl -p -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;s/($TAGS)/ warning: \$1/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is an unmissable warning whenever you run your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/todo-warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TODO warnings in an Xcode Swift project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I feel more compelled to clean up these yellow warnings than ticking things off in a todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:comments&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If your code needs commenting, it isn’t clear enough. Refactor until it is. If it doesn’t make sense because of semantics, rethink your naming conventions. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:comments&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been donating blood for just over 10 years and went for my quarterly donation yesterday. If you don’t donate already, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://blood.co.uk&quot;&gt;finding your nearest donor session&lt;/a&gt; and donating - most donations are done with a mobile team and are likely to be in a village hall or similar. It is a fairly quick and painless process and the National Blood Service is always in need of regular supplies for transplants and cancer treatment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:rare&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:rare&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not only do you get to save lives and have your blood screened for anything dangeous, you also get a cup of tea and some biscuits afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blood.co.uk/&quot;&gt;National Blood Service website&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and find your nearest donor session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:rare&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Especially if you have a rare blood type. I’m AB- which has the smallest amount of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blood.co.uk/about-blood/stock-levels-statistics/&quot;&gt;stock in the national blood bank&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:rare&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Private lives</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/29/private-lives/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/29/private-lives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend the news broke that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29396942&quot;&gt;Brooks Newmark had resigned from the government&lt;/a&gt; due to a sting by the Sunday Mirror. A journalist posed as a young female Conservative activist and they ended up flirting via Whatsapp with him eventually sending some lewd photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this is a fairly simple case of entrapment with a journalist pretending to be somebody in order to get a gossip story for a newspaper. This does not require a resignation and is a further indication of what is wrong with our politics; MPs are not held to account the same as regular people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you worked on the checkout in ASDA and you started flirting with someone on Whatsapp despite being married, you don’t have to resign when everybody finds out. However, you do have to resign if you take money from the till&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sacked&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sacked&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it should be for MPs. They are regular people and they shouldn’t have to give up their career for stupid things they have done in their private lives that are totally legal. The argument “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brooks-newmark-lied-wife---4342177&quot;&gt;he lied to his wife so what stops him lying to voters&lt;/a&gt;” is idiotic; unless there is proof that his private life is affecting his work, then it is certainly not in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an MP or any other public figure is doing something illegal, then it is fair to hold them to account. It is not fair to use their private life especially if they have been manipulated into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sacked&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Well, you’d be sacked actually. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sacked&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>IslandBreak</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/26/islandbreak/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/26/islandbreak/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that an app I worked on earlier this year has finally gone live on the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandbreakapp.com/&quot;&gt;IslandBreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/islandbreak.png&quot; alt=&quot;IslandBreak for iPhone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IslandBreak is a smart travel guide for the Bahamas with a complete list of restaurants, bars, historical sites, hotels, beaches, and tours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app was interesting to work on due to the need for a completely offline experience. This wasn’t limited to just the points of interest and itineraries (which feature a huge amount of beautiful high-resolution photos) but also the map; this was a requirement so that tourists don’t have to use their data plans, particularly in an area which has very poor mobile reception&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:reception&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:reception&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Getting a full map of the islands complete with multiple zoom levels and the experience you expect on iOS was difficult, but works really well. In addition, I built an online CMS so that the app content can be updated remotely without going through the App Store approval process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/islandbreak-travel-guide-for/id839013319?mt=8&quot;&gt;downloading from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (currently priced at $0.99) or visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandbreakapp.com/&quot;&gt;islandbreakapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:reception&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I speak from experience. I’ve been to the Bahamas a few times and proposed to my wife there; we had to wait until we were back in Florida before we could share the news! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:reception&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>iOS using internal reference name for IAP</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/25/ios-8-using-internal-reference-name-for-iap/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 16:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/25/ios-8-using-internal-reference-name-for-iap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I noticed a slightly worrying bug in iOS. In-App Purchases seem to be using the internal reference name rather than the localized display name. As an example here is my config for one of the consumable IAPs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/ios8-iap-edit.png&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Connect Edit IAP Language&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/ios8-iap-summary.png&quot; alt=&quot;iTunes Connect Edit IAP Summary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference name is ‘v1.1 25000 Honeycombs’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:reference&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the display name for UK English is ‘pack of 25000 honeycombs’. This means the purchase screen ends up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/ios8-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;iOS 8 IAP Display Name incorrect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardly ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I double checked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectInAppPurchase_Guide/Chapters/CreatingInAppPurchaseProducts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013727-CH3-SW3&quot;&gt;In-App Purchase Configuration Guide&lt;/a&gt; and it still states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Reference Name field, enter an internal name for the product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not been able to see this in other apps as most people will use the same display name and reference name. I’ve reported a bug with the Apple Bug Reporter &lt;a href=&quot;http://openradar.io/18454842&quot;&gt;Filed as 18454842&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to check your own IAPs to make sure the reference name looks ok until this gets fixed. You can change them without going through App Review (as they aren’t supposed to be visible to end users).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (26th September 2014):&lt;/strong&gt; Tony McBride emailed me to say that he was experiencing the same issues on iOS 7 building against the iOS 7 SDK. I’ve confirmed it is happening in WallaBee v1.4.1 (built with iOS 8 SDK) running on iOS 7. Looks like it may be an App Store issue rather than an iOS 8 issue. I’ve updated this post to remove references to it being a solely iOS 8 problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:reference&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering why, I forget exactly. I think there were different packs in v1.0 which we then increased in v1.1 - some of the increases overlapped (i.e. 15000 became 25000) and so I had to use a different name. Prepending the version seemed to be a sensible choice as nobody would see it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:reference&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How not to deliver a speech</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/24/how-not-to-deliver-a-speech/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 09:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/24/how-not-to-deliver-a-speech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Ed Miliband delivered his speech to the Labour Party conference but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29339581&quot;&gt;embarrassingly left out a large portion&lt;/a&gt; about one of the most important topics of this decade; the budget defecit&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:joke&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:joke&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given quite a few speeches in the past and often give out advice to people (mainly developers) who are preparing to give a presentation or some form of pitch. The two key pieces of advice I always give out are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t write your speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t use notes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, you should never write a speech out in full. To do this means you are then locked in and can’t adapt to a changing situation. This is especially true if you are doing a speech in which you have to follow someone, something goes wrong&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:apple&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:apple&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or you are talking about things that could change. Additionally, I don’t believe in using notes. Nobody wants to see their presenter looking down at a little card, or worse, a mobile phone. If you are going to use notes, keep them discreetly on a table and only consult them whilst your audience is applauding or laughing (if they are doing neither, change your speech). They should also be only the loosest of bullet points to keep you on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed made a mistake by breaking both of these rules badly. He wrote a speech but then made changes at the 11th hour (about the Scottish referendum) making it harder to memorise; he also (very stupidly) distributed the speech in advance so it was obvious when he had left something out. Finally, he had notes printed on thin paper through a clear table; easy for anybody with a camera (i.e. the national press in the front row at a political conference) to see and know when you’ve missed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of exceptions to these rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are doing a presentation which includes some form of slideshow software, this is a lot easier as the bullet point skeleton is already written for you. You don’t need any notes, just be sure to scan over the upcoming slide whilst you are talking and be ready to speak around that subject. Never repeat what is written on a slide (which should be sparse) unless it is a quote. Any presentation by Apple is a great example of how to do this incredibly well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are delivering a eulogy, these rules do not apply. You should have it written in full and printed to read from. Never give a eulogy from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing with any speech or presentation is to sound authentic. To do that, I believe you have to connect directly with an audience and not rely on remembering huge passages of text. It is much easier to have a few loose bullet points in your mind and then flesh it out as you are presenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, a speech is simply a one-way conversation with multiple people. Imagine you are telling a friend about the thing you are speaking on and everything should fall into place easily. If you try to remember an essay, then the speech will be difficult to remember, uncomfortable to watch, and far more likely to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:joke&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You could say he had a defecit in his speech &lt;em&gt;*rimshot*&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:joke&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:apple&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My favourite example of this is the original iPhone launch. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OEsI0Sc_s&amp;amp;t=1h14m59s&quot;&gt;Towards the end of the presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Job’s ‘clicker’ broke so he couldn’t advance the presentation. Whilst he was waiting for it to be fixed, he told a brilliant anecdote about Steve Wozniak jamming televisions when they were younger. The whole delivery was natural and unscripted and he was able to recover straight back to talking about predicted market share - you can’t do that when you are leaning heavily on memory nor a text-heavy presentation. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:apple&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The illusion of choice</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/23/the-illusion-of-choice/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/23/the-illusion-of-choice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last week, I’ve tried to purchase two things that made me question the way in which choices are presented to us whilst purchasing. It also made me think about how we market our in app purchases within &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first choice I questioned was Disney Infinity 2.0, the latest version of the sandbox game that lets you mix and match Disney characters in a toy box environment. At launch, there are only 2 ways to get the game; buying the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Disney-Infinity-Marvel-Superheroes-Starter/dp/B00JQYN7W4/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1411455254&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=disney+infinity+2++xbox+one&quot;&gt;Marvel Superheroes Starter Pack&lt;/a&gt; (£57)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:marvel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:marvel&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which includes 3 figures and a play set piece (which gives you several hours of themed game play) or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Disney-Infinity-Toybox-Pack-Xbox/dp/B00MTG1PRU/ref=sr_1_6?s=videogames&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1411455254&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;keywords=disney+infinity+2++xbox+one&quot;&gt;Disney Toybox Pack&lt;/a&gt; (£55) which comes with just 2 figures and 2 game discs (which give you power ups). Both sets come with a USB base to place your characters on and the actual videogame software (on disc) which gives you the Toy Box mode. The issue here is that the Marvel pack comes with an extra character and a play set piece&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:playset&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:playset&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which will give you much more than just the toy box for only £2 extra. My second issue is that there is no upgrade path for those like me that already have a lot of the original Disney Infinity stuff. I already have a USB base and 17 characters so I really only need the videogame disc in order to get the new toy box mode up and running; I could then buy something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00LGYJBJ0/ref=s9_simh_gw_p63_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=191X9FSDAEAJWFGFXW9Q&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=455344027&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=468294&quot;&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Playset Pack&lt;/a&gt; (£28) which gives you a playset piece and 2 characters to use within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, there is no way to get the software either on its own or in a digital form which seems crazy in this day and age. Nearly all of my Xbox One games are the digital versions because I hate having to swap the discs to play a game (especially when it is only reading it to unlock the DRM - the actual game is installed onto the hard drive so the disc is used purely for authentication).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll most likely end up buying the Marvel version as it just makes financial sense even though I’m not that interested in the characters or the playset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second purchase that I’ve questioned was the new iPhone 6 models. The pricing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:iphonepricing&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:iphonepricing&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; looks like this for the iPhone 6 Plus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;16GB: £619&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;64GB: £699&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;128GB: £789&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice anything strange? Each storage capacity was doubled from the iPhone 5S except the 16GB model which stays the same. This leads to a very disjointed price list as the gap between the 16GB and the 64GB is only £80 and there is no 32GB model - it makes no sense that you would choose the 16GB over the 64GB especially when you consider that the iPhone 6 models have far better cameras and can do things like 240fps and time lapse videos which will eat that up (not to mention the @3x resolution bumping up the size of every app as they get updated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last 2 years I’ve had 16GB iPhone models and it has become apparent that they are just not big enough (as many people found when trying to upgrade to iOS 8 over the air). I regularly have to delete my music cache to save space or offload photos and videos. I would have been happy paying a bit extra for a 32GB (or having the base model doubled) but in the end I went for 64GB on both phones as I just don’t see 16GB being a workable size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do companies do this? In the case of Disney Infinity, I think they just want to cover their backs and try to stop anybody buying the game without the USB base and some characters as otherwise the game won’t work. My wife suggested they could make the game available as a digital download but just put a warning that you need to have some bits from the previous game; from experience I know that nobody reads those warnings. With the iPhone 6, I can only imagine that they really want people to buy the 64GB model and so by starting at 16GB they are basically showing you a bad option in the hope you’ll buy the better model. This has an extra benefit that they can say “starting at £619” when they know most people will go to the £699 model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do something very similar in WallaBee with our packs of honeycombs (our freemium currency). Here is a quick list of the packs we sell along with their price&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:salesprice&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:salesprice&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the percentage of sales&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:salespercentage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:salespercentage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; each one has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25000hc - £7.99 - 81%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20000hc - £6.99 - 1%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15000hc - £5.49 - 12%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5000hc - £2.49 - 3%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2500hc - £1.49 - 2%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1000hc - £0.69 - 1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the 25000hc pack is overwhelmingly the most popular. This may be because it has a “most popular” banner attached to it on the purchase page but I think it is picked the most because it is the best value when you look at a strict honeycombs to pence conversion (we don’t do any additional benefits like adding some other currency or benefit on the higher packages - they are literally you get what you buy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point I’m getting is that we could probably scrap all but the 25000hc and 15000hc packs without negatively affecting sales, but then there would be less choice available to our players. We did drop a 10000hc pack a while ago when we were experimenting with a grid based sales page; it was the least popular option and we wanted just 6 items to keep the design even. I’m not sure if minimising the amount of options further would be good as it means making people compromise as in the case of Disney Infinity and the iPhone 6; I’ll buy the options they are pushing me too but I won’t feel good about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting counterpoint to this is the way in which we sell locks within WallaBee. Locks allow you to protect items you drop from being taken by other people and we sell them in packs of 10 for £0.69. Many players have asked us to sell them in packs like honeycombs so that we could do a range of options for each budget but the reason we keep them at a single price point is that they are massively popular; in fact, they are our most purchased in app purchase&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mostpurchased&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mostpurchased&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Whilst selling a pack of 50 or a 100 might generate more sales, it would mean that a £0.69 in app purchase would no longer be most popular. Why is that important? On the App Store, you can see the top in app purchases for a game and it is my feeling that showing a £0.69 item at the top of that list rather than a £7.99 one looks better to new players who are often sceptical about how much money a freemium game is going to try and take from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty pleased with the way that we do real world transactions in WallaBee but we are going to be making a big drive for what we like to call “ethical freemium” in the future with several big changes. One of the things we don’t do now and never will is sell huge packs at prices like £64.99 - I see this in many freemium games and it is just gross (as well as looking bad in the “top in app purchases” screen on the App Store). Something I have often toyed with for those that do want to make larger purchases, such as those who want to buy multiple lock packs, is to add some form of payment processing on our website that is separate to the App Store; that way, players could buy as many locks as they want without affecting our top purchases list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, choice is simply an illusion. Most of the time, you are being cajoled into making a specific purchase. In the case of Disney Infinity and the iPhone 6, it seems pretty obvious. With WallaBee, we’ve experimented both with offering choice (as in our honeycomb packs) and offering no choice (with our locks). It’s hard to say which works best but I think I prefer having a single option to choose from rather than being given several but being subliminally pushed to a chosen option. Maybe I should remove those superfluous honeycomb packs after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:marvel&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://direct.asda.com/Disney-Infinity-2.0-Collector%27s-Edition-Avengers-Starter-Pack---PS3/003751266,default,pd.html&amp;amp;cmpid=ppc-_-ad-pla-_-ggle-pla-_-Video-Games-and-Consoles-_-003751266&amp;amp;cm_mmc=ad-ppc-_-ggle-pla-_-Video-Games-and-Consoles-_-003751266&amp;amp;istCompanyId=71f4ae42-94c5-4821-aa58-05eff6da2486&amp;amp;istItemId=watmpparq&amp;amp;istBid=tztx&quot;&gt;Collector’s Edition&lt;/a&gt;” as well at £110 but it is essentially the same thing with more characters. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:marvel&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:playset&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The play sets are basically movie tie-in games in that you can only use characters from that series within them and you’ll get around 5-10 hours of story driven gameplay. It means that Disney can release a new game within Disney Infinity without having to redistribute the base software (you just buy one of these pieces that goes on the USB board). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:playset&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:iphonepricing&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is for an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus in the UK. Obviously with a carrier and a plan the cost would be different. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:iphonepricing&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:salesprice&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The price differs around the world based on tiers that Apple sets up - they scale beautifully in USD but look less obvious in GBP. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:salesprice&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:salespercentage&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Data from 22nd August 2014 to 22nd September 2014. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:salespercentage&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:mostpurchased&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is the IAP that most people buy; it isn’t the one that makes the most money (that would be the 25000hc pack) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mostpurchased&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Font Finder Featured</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/03/font-finder-featured/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/09/03/font-finder-featured/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote an extension for Firefox called &lt;a href=&quot;http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/&quot;&gt;Font Finder&lt;/a&gt;. It was a basic utility that let you highlight any text in a website and immediately get detailed font information such as family, leading, line-height, etc. It’s been downloaded half a million times and had great reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped using Firefox a long time ago and so when it came to update the app a developer named &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/AndyPortmen/&quot;&gt;Andy Portmen&lt;/a&gt; asked if he could continue to work on the extension. He published an update in July which bought the extension up-to-date with the latest version of Firefox and Font Finder has now been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2014/09/01/september-featured-add-ons-2/&quot;&gt;featured by Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a designer that uses Firefox, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;. My thanks to Andy for keeping Font Finder alive for those users who have found it useful over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retiring TubeUpdates and WikiLocation</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2014 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m sad to announce that both TubeUpdates.com and WikiLocation.org have been retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tubeupdates&quot;&gt;TubeUpdates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started in 2009 as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://niksilver.com/2009/08/02/guardian-hack-day-2/&quot;&gt;Guardian Hack Day 2&lt;/a&gt;, TubeUpdates.com was an API that allowed you to find out the status of each of the London Underground lines. It worked by screen scraping the TfL website every minute of the day and for the past 5 years it has stored data on every status update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in March of this year, the API stopped fetching new data due to changes to the TfL website. As TfL were now providing their own richer API, I announced it would be retired in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API will now return a 404 error for all endpoints. I’d recommend checking out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds#on-this-page-1&quot;&gt;the TfL API&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement for live status information. If you are interested in historical information, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/tubeupdates.sql.zip&quot;&gt;download a MySQL dump&lt;/a&gt; of all of the status updates I retrieved during the 5 year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wikilocation&quot;&gt;WikiLocation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built WikiLocation in 2010 as I was working on an app which needed to fetch Wikipedia articles that were nearby. As it turned out, I never got around to building that app but the API took off and has been used around the world. At the time of writing, there was only one unofficial API that fetched geocoded articles and it was woefully out of date. I was informed by a Wikipedia staff member recently (quite rudely) that they now have their own API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to retire WikiLocation for a while but some issues with my hosting company this week have accelerated this as some automatic updates they added have killed my infrastructure. WikiLocation was the last site on the old hardware and the time it would take to rewrite it and put it onto new hosting is time I don’t have (especially considering that donations for the service from those who have used it haven’t covered a single week of the hosting I’ve been paying for over the last 4 years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API will now return a 404 error for all endpoints. You may want to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GeoData#API&quot;&gt;the official API from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (I haven’t looked into it myself) or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/wikilocation-dumps/index.html&quot;&gt;download the latest MySQL dumps&lt;/a&gt; (in 38 languages) of the data I retrieved. Alternatively, you can take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.toolserver.org/view/Ghel&quot;&gt;original python script&lt;/a&gt; that crawls the Wikipedia linking tables to build your own scraper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always a shame to have to terminate a service and I apologise for the inconvenience this may cause as there was no deprecation time. However, it just isn’t feasible for me to rewrite the entire API for new hosting when there are other alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off on honeymoon!</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/23/off-on-honeymoon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, I had the great honour of marrying my beautiful girlfriend Becky at Dodford Manor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/10487463_10100587207409054_5008795261987088123_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Benjamin and Rebecca Dodson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now going on honeymoon to Vancouver, Alaska, and Whistler until August 11th. I will have limited internet connectivity and won’t be checking emails but I’ll reply to them upon my return; I expect there will be a lot and we are moving house during that week so I should have reached inbox zero by August 20th. If you are having any issues with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, please email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#115;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#119;&amp;#097;&amp;#108;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&quot;&gt;&amp;#115;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#119;&amp;#097;&amp;#108;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LEGO MINI Cooper</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/19/lego-mini-cooper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re a LEGO VIP member (and you should be) then you can now &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/VIP-Early-Access-10242&quot;&gt;purchase the new LEGO MINI Cooper model&lt;/a&gt; which doesn’t go on sale to the general public until August 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a must have model for me and I think it’s going to be really popular based on the response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Volkswagen-T1-Camper-Van-10220&quot;&gt;LEGO Volkswagon T1 Camper Van&lt;/a&gt; which has been around for a few years now. The MINI is full of rare pieces (I particularly like the old windscreen pieces sprayed in British Racing Green to work as wheel arches) and nice features such as an engine, detachable roof, cross-check seating, and a picnic hamper in the boot. The design is top notch and I’m really looking forward to building it although I still need to finish R2-D2, the Sandcrawler, and a Rancor Pit so may be a little while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting observation: LEGO and MINI are the only two companies I know that both have an all-capitalised name which most people ignore (or worse in the case of LEGO, pluralise unnecessary - they’re not ‘&lt;em&gt;legos&lt;/em&gt;’!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that an app I’ve been working on for the past few months has now gone live in the App Store; &lt;a href=&quot;http://kontentapp.com/&quot;&gt;kontent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/kontent_iPhone_4-2wqcuextzf2aii6rby9534.png&quot; alt=&quot;kontent for iPhone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kontent is a great way of sharing valuable content between your friends as it limits you to sending just one link (called a &lt;em&gt;blink&lt;/em&gt;) per day. The app has a really nice design in keeping with iOS 7 and the guys running the company are &lt;a href=&quot;/weblog/2014/07/03/awesome-client/&quot;&gt;top notch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app has been really interesting to work on as I’ve been developing a number of interesting features such as the ability to use the app offline for a large number of actions (i.e. you can send a blink whilst you are offline and it’ll sync up to the cloud when you go online). However, the big piece for me has been the animations; from the moment you open the app you’ll be introduced to a series of delightful and thoughtful animations. Everything has a purpose whilst remaining playful and dynamic. It has been a heap of fun to work on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really pleased with the way this app has turned out and look forward to working with kontent over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kontent/id852276203?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;downloading from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; (it’s 100% free with no ads) or visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://kontentapp.com/&quot;&gt;kontentapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blocks Magazine</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/12/blocks-magazine/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/12/blocks-magazine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to see that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blocksmag.com&quot;&gt;Blocks Magazine&lt;/a&gt; sold enough copies to prove it as a concept and is now going to be a monthly publication starting in October:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Blocks magazine is going monthly from autumn 2014. The first issue of this exciting new magazine written by LEGO enthusiasts, for LEGO enthusiasts, is due to hit the shops on Thurs 23rd Oct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve started offering &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blocksmag.com/#!subcribe/c7dd&quot;&gt;yearly and 2-yearly subscriptions on their website&lt;/a&gt; - an instant purchase for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of LEGO and you haven’t picked up the first issue yet, it is well worth getting. It has a lot more content than I was expecting for a pilot magazine (including an excellent review of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Sandcrawler-75059&quot;&gt;Star Wars Sandcrawler&lt;/a&gt;) but the proof reading leaves a lot to be desired. Loads of great stuff though so highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you run your own company, you get to do silly things like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/20140710-e096b42dfa8291b2eadec6ff1bdf43a86d46d7204815e0eac979c4e-512.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thatcher the Wonder Pug from &#39;Introducing... The Forager&#39; on WallaBee&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of minutes, hundreds of copies of this item had been mixed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; and hopefully bought a smile to our players faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running WallaBee is much like the spirit of this item; joyful randomness without a care in the world. I hope we never lose that as we continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple TV gains iTunes Extras</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/11/apple-tv-gains-itunes-extras/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 00:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/07/11/apple-tv-gains-itunes-extras/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my pet hates is purchasing DVDs and Blu-Rays. It seems so clunky and out-dated in an age where nearly everything I consume is stored on my hard drives. I also have a real problem with paying for a physical product and then having to wait an average of 70 seconds to start playing the movie due to sitting through either adverts bundled on the disc or anti-piracy messages that can’t be skipped (or elaborate menus that take 20 seconds of animation before you can select “&lt;em&gt;play film&lt;/em&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time I ever buy them these days is when there is a film I really loved and has extras that I want to watch. Most recently, this has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/the-lego-movie/id805917617&quot;&gt;The LEGO Movie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/the-grand-budapest-hotel/id828782657&quot;&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was able to cancel my pre-orders of both from Amazon thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/10/itunes-11-3-itunes-extras-apple-tv-ios-8/&quot;&gt;iTunes Extras now being re-enabled on the Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;. iTunes Extras are essentially small HTML5 apps bundled with movies you buy from iTunes and act as the “extras” piece you usually get with a DVD or Blu-Ray. Until recently, they’ve only worked on Mac (and for a while on the original Apple TV) so I haven’t really spent much time with them - I don’t watch films on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only had a quick play with them but I’m liking what I see already. Both films were cheaper on iTunes (HD) than buying on a physical disc and came with the same extras as far as I can tell. In addition, The LEGO Movie was available today whereas the Blu-Ray isn’t available for another 2 weeks here in the UK. Best of all, when you start the film, it starts immediately with no anti-piracy notices and nothing that can’t be fast-forwarded; you get exactly what you paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2014/grand-budapest-itunes-extras.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel iTunes Extras on Apple TV&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? Simply press “&lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;” on a movie with iTunes Extras and you’ll be shown a splash screen where you can then choose to watch the movie as usual, view the extras that are available, view a cast list (along with other films they are featured in), or view similar films. One strange thing I found was that the extras for The LEGO Movie didn’t show up on the Apple TV and looking at the listing within iTunes it says “Available on your Mac or PC”. The movie is featured prominently in the marketing material for the new extras so I have to imagine that it just hasn’t rolled out fully yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t have an Apple TV yet, this is another feature which might persuade them. However, I’m still anticipating an updated model later in the year with some form of game support; the combination of an A8 chip, the new Metal framework, and the controllers introduced with iOS 7 seems to point to what could be a very nice, if simple, gaming machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get iTunes Extras, simply apply the update that has appeared on Apple TV today. Lots of films have iTunes Extras with them and many previous films have had extras added which you get automatically if you already own the film. iTunes Extras are also coming to iOS 8 when it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on an app for a client for the past few months that is due to launch very shortly. To thank me for my work, they bought me this. I love my clients!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/10514038_800218873345445_1427415910_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO R2D2 from awesome client&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll post a review once I get around to building it - I’ve already promised them they’ve delayed any bug fixes until it’s built…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; the app is now live and I can now reveal that my awesome client is &lt;a href=&quot;http://kontentapp.com&quot;&gt;kontent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dropping non-retina support in iOS 7</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/10/16/dropping-non-retina-support-in-ios7/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 13:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/10/16/dropping-non-retina-support-in-ios7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in June 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/10/does-ios-5-finally-allow-retina-display-iphone-apps-to-run-unscaled-on-the-ipad/&quot;&gt;I posited that Apple should remove the 1x/2x toggle on iPhone apps running on the iPad&lt;/a&gt; and instead just use the retina versions at fullscreen. I’ve mainly been working on updating apps to be compatible with iOS 7 over the past month and I noticed that this change had been made and non-retina iPads (namely the iPad 2 and iPad Mini) now just use retina assets. The 1x/2x toggle is dead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous behaviour for iPads was that they would run a 320x480px boxed version of your app in the center of the display. If you pressed the 2x button, the app would be enlarged to 640x960px but would still use the same assets leading to a fuzzy mess. The retina iPads had it slightly better as they would use the larger assets and retina font smoothing leading to a better experience. In iOS 7, retina iPads (currently the 3rd and 4th generation) still allow this same toggle but the non-retina iPads (only the iPad 2 and iPad Mini on iOS 7) are now locked at 2x using your retina assets and font smoothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic news as it signals the end of non-retina device support. If you are making an iPhone app that is iOS 7 only (sensible if it’s a new app), you no longer have to worry about supporting non-retina devices as the iPads will use your retina assets. For developers, this has 3 key benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only need @2x files in your app bundle:&lt;/strong&gt; This leads to smaller sizes for your app bundle and less hassle in creating all of your 1x assets in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less complex code for images fetched over network as you only need one size:&lt;/strong&gt; For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wallabee/id479211430?mt=8&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; I have a UIImageView subclass that fetches images for me based on the scale of the UIScreen. If the UIImageView is 100 points square, it would download a 200x200px image on retina devices and 100x100px image on non-retina devices. This is no longer necessary saving some complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use finer design elements:&lt;/strong&gt; for example, using 1px (rather than 1pt) dividing lines. You can also use images that have an odd number of pixels (previously a 99px image was generally forbidden as you’d need a 49.5px image for non-retina displays which wouldn’t work). Nearly every designer I’ve worked with has designed at retina resolution with odd numbered sizes for key elements so this is very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited that we can now drop support for non-retina displays; it’ll definitely speed up some of my workflows. You will obviously still need to support non-retina devices if you are building a Universal or iPad only app though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been rewatching Frasier recently (just finished the 7th season) and it is still an absolutely fantastic show. Witty writing, great characters, and very few bad episodes (rare in most comedy series - there are usually a lot of duds as they age).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, one of the episodes I’ve just watched, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0582564/&quot;&gt;They’re Playing Our Song&lt;/a&gt;, has Frasier composing his own theme tune for his radio show. Rather than being a 10 second jingle, it turns into a 2-minute orchestral track with a voiceover from Niles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch and enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LEGO Super Star Destroyer</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/05/09/lego-super-star-destroyer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2013 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/05/09/lego-super-star-destroyer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally fulfilled one of my longterm dreams and bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Super-Star-Destroyer-10221&quot;&gt;LEGO Super Star Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; whilst it was on offer for Star Wars Day (May 4th). The Super Star Destroyer (also known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Executor&quot;&gt;‘The Executor’&lt;/a&gt;) is a complete beast; it measures in at around 4.2 feet long and 8 pounds in weight. It’s the most expensive set LEGO currently sell but is 3rd in terms of number of pieces (it has 3152 pieces compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Death-Star-10188&quot;&gt;Death Star&lt;/a&gt; with 3803 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Tower-Bridge-10214&quot;&gt;Tower Bridge&lt;/a&gt; with 4295 - I don’t really like either of those sets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8722376957/in/set-72157633440335423/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/8722376957_887287b307_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Super Star Destroyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some photos of the build process and completed model in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/sets/72157633440335423/&quot;&gt;my Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; but I will include a few shots here to highlight some of the best (and worst) bits of the build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-emperor&quot;&gt;The Emperor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8722351965/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/8722351965_2ab9599424_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Darth Vader and Emperor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I started building the set that I realised this is, amazingly, the first LEGO Star Wars set I’ve built (not counting the LEGO Star Wars Advent calendars in 2011 and 2012). This was, therefore, the first Darth Vader minifig I’ve collected but even better than that was the Emperor hologram that I didn’t know existed, let alone was in this set. A really nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manual-and-boxes&quot;&gt;Manual and boxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8723468992/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/8723468992_f63f90af07_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Super Star Destroyer - boxes and manual&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern LEGO sets come in numbered bags so that you can build the model in stages. This is useful for all sets but especially important for the models with thousands of pieces as you don’t want to open them all and spend days foraging around for the bit you need. This is the first set I’ve seen that comes not just with bags, but numbered boxes! The manual is also worth mentioning as it is spiral bound and weighs a ton. It also came in its own box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;star-destroyer&quot;&gt;Star Destroyer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8723500448/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/8723500448_25a6666d4d_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Star Destroyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another nice touch, a Star Destroyer in scale with the rest of the model so you can understand just how huge the Executor is supposed to be. Even when watching the films I hadn’t really noticed how huge this ship is supposed to be but the detail placard points out that it would have a crew of 280,735. This is a nice way of showing the scale and the miniature model is quite clever with hinges to form the shape and clear plastic arms to hold it to the side of the Super Star Destroyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;control-room&quot;&gt;Control Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8723485422/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7387/8723485422_3a673d60ea_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Star Destroyer - Control room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only negative in the set in my opinion. It’s the control room of the ship where a lot of the action in ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ takes place (particularly the scene where Vader briefs the bounty hunters, several of whom are minifigs in this set). The nice part is that it replicates this room perfectly with the walkway, sub-level computers, and sliding doors. The problem is that it uses a lot of stickers (which I hate) and that it is completely off scale with the rest of the model. In proper scale, this should be about 2x3 studs (or smaller) but it has been designed so minifigs can fit inside. Fortunately the whole thing is hidden under a beautifully designed lifting piece but I just dislike that this has been added to give it a ‘play’ element when it is clearly a collectors build rather than a toy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/8723494562/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/8723494562_80cf52bc4e_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LEGO Super Star Destroyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an absolutely fantastic set. It took me around 3 days to build (due to being slightly ill and having other things to do) but is probably 6-8 hours worth of solid building. There are so many cleverly designed elements that it is bound to be unique for many LEGO builders. I particularly liked the use of coloured bricks in the interior sections in order to break up the grey making it easier to see where you were in the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set is an absolute beast and I’d encourage you to take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/sets/72157633440335423/&quot;&gt;full photo set&lt;/a&gt; which shows it being built from start to finish. Now it’s time to wait until July for my next projects; the Lone Ranger sets and the new Lord of the Rings sets (including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/The-Tower-of-Orthanc-10237&quot;&gt;Tower of Orthanc&lt;/a&gt;… can’t wait!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first got my Apple TV, the main issue I had was that my artwork looked crappy for some of the TV shows I’d downloaded from places other than iTunes. I’d been using a combination of Google Image Search and screenshotting and cropping the iTunes Store to get artwork and it looked awful on a big TV. To solve that, I wrote a small script to fetch TV Show artwork from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html#searching&quot;&gt;iTunes Search API&lt;/a&gt;. They only display 100px artwork but with some URL fudgery I was able to get 600x600px artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project became a lot more popular than I imagined and I was soon inundated with requests to add new features such as searching across international iTunes stores and adding movie artwork. More recently, I’ve been asked to add iBooks artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of spare time this morning so I’ve updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;the project page&lt;/a&gt; and added a fair few new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Types&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ve extended the iTunes Artwork Finder to now work with not only TV Shows and Movies, but also iBooks, Apps, and Music Albums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; - I discovered that I was able to get higher than 600x600px artwork in some instances. Movies can be upto 1800x2400px and I’ve seen some TV shows at 2400x2400px. Apps will always be at 512px square or 1024px square depending on when the app was released or last updated. iBooks, Movies, and Music Albums are a bit problematic as licensing issues often prevent the high resolution artwork being made visible. I’ve left the link there as it does work with some (seems to depend on the studio) but there is a caveat listeed as I don’t expect you’ll get good results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countries&lt;/strong&gt; - There are now 5 iTunes Stores that can be searched across; UK, US, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. If you want your country added, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty pleased with the update, particularly now that I’ve managed to get album covers and iBooks worked out (and I think the app icon search could be useful). &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;Give it a try&lt;/a&gt; and let me know how you get on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/&quot;&gt;Try out the iTunes Artwork Finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harry Potter at the Warner Bros Studio Tour</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/02/18/harry-potter-at-the-warner-bros-studio-tour/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took my girlfriend to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk&quot;&gt;Warner Bros Studio Tour&lt;/a&gt; (which is entirely Harry Potter based) on Valentine’s Day and had a few observations I wanted to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tour&lt;/strong&gt; - If you’re a Harry Potter fan or interested in how movies are made, then it is a great tour. You get to see a large number of sets, props, and artwork along with a few interactive elements such as flying on a broomstick to see how ‘green screening’ works. The things that really stood out to me were how small some of the sets were and also how much effort they go to with some things (i.e. the Dursley’s house is on the backlot.. they found it easier to build a fake house than film on location). The highlight of the tour is a huge model replica of Hogwarts which took 72 man years to build. It really is stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queues&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the first attraction I’ve ever seen which only lets you buy tickets in advance (you can’t just turn up on the day). On arriving, it was evident why; the place was packed! When you order your tickets, you choose a half hour window from which you are allowed to enter the attraction. We got there 45 minutes early so milled around the gift shop and the coffee bar but there were lots of other people doing the same (I’d estimate around 400-500 people). We spent a further 45 minutes queueing to get into the attraction which is slow going as there is a 10 minute cinema piece before hand. Whilst it was irritating to wait a while, it definitely paid off as this drip feeding into the studios means you enter the Great Hall (the first stop) with around 100 other people. This is the only ‘guided’ bit of the tour with someone pointing out various aspects of the set but then you are free to walk around the next bits at your own pace. It never really felt overcrowded despite appearances from the outside and I can understand why they chose this ticketing system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Guide&lt;/strong&gt; - When I bought the tickets, there was an option to pay a bit more and get a digital guide and a printed guide. I did this expecting the digital guide to be something on a website or an interactive PDF but it was actually one of those things you walk around the tour with along with a headset. I didn’t use it, but I had a good look at it after I noticed one of the videos had iOS controls. It turns out there was an iPod Touch inside just wrapped in grey plastic which most likely had a battery booster and theft detection thing in it. I don’t know how they did it, but I saw one couple who had managed to get to the iOS home screen which confirmed it (along with the giveaway 30 pin connector on the base and the slight curved shine of a metal back inside). The guide itself is simply an iOS app that you press buttons on to get audio and information about (there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://visitour.com/warner-brothers-studio-tour-the-making-of-harry-potter-app-review/&quot;&gt;full review on the Visitour website&lt;/a&gt;) but it seemed pretty good. Having said that, we didn’t bother using it. I think it would have been nice if the app could have been downloaded on to our own devices to be used later on (i.e. looking through the physical guide and having some audio to listen to along with it) but I was more intrigued by the use of iPod Touches as guides rather than a bespoke device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiFi&lt;/strong&gt; - I didn’t use it, but I was impressed that there was free WiFi throughout the tour. Nice if you’re the sort of person that wants to upload photos as soon as you take them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPads&lt;/strong&gt; - Not really an observation of the tour so much, but I saw a lot of people taking photos on their iPads (both the 10” and 7.85” models). This strikes me as very odd as I saw most of them had iPhones or other smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercialisation&lt;/strong&gt; - If you’ve got kids, get ready to spend a lot of cash in the gift shop. They have nearly everything you can imagine with Harry Potter plastered on it and at a steep price as well (i.e. a small bag of Bertie Bott’s jelly beans is £9). My girlfriend pointed out that there wasn’t a single item for under £2 aside from postcards at 90p each. You kind of expect it these days but I’d find it genuinely fascinating to know how much money they make each day. In terms of stock, it’s the same stuff they sell at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/&quot;&gt;Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt; (although it’s more expensive then buying in dollars - a Chocolate frog is $10 in the US but £8 in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an awesome day out and I’d highly recommend it. There was plenty to see and do and a lot of the sets and props are incredibly impressive. Just be ready to queue at the beginning, and empty your wallet at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘CACurrentMediaTime()’</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/29/ca-current-media-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/29/ca-current-media-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may remember me &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/22/syncing-the-wallabee-store/&quot;&gt;extolling the virtues of CACurrentMediaTime()&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago in relation to keeping track of time on iOS (specifically in allowing me to sync up the WallaBee Store to the nearest second around the world).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a retraction of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that CACurrentMediaTime() has a fatal flaw. Whilst it’s designed to be a counter, it only actually works whilst the iPhone (or iPad) is active. Here is how it’s described by Apple in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/22/syncing-the-wallabee-store/&quot;&gt;their documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Returns the current absolute time, in seconds. A &lt;em&gt;CFTimeInterval&lt;/em&gt; derived by calling &lt;em&gt;mach_absolute_time()&lt;/em&gt; and converting the result to seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further inspection of mach_absolute_time() gives us very little (documentation is very sparse). On Mac OS X, mach_absolute_time() is based on the last time the device booted (it gives you the number of seconds since you turned your computer on) so it seems prudent that this would be similar on iOS. Apple give some &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1398/_index.html&quot;&gt;cursory examples&lt;/a&gt; of how to convert mach_absolute_time() from nanoseconds into seconds and in doing so point out that “the function is CPU dependent” and needs to be converted by the system rather than by constants. There is no mention of how it all works but the general consensus seems to be that it’s uptime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from it’s not. Unfortunately for me, it took an App Store release for this bug to be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the interesting thing about mach_absolute_time() is that it appears to be the ‘active’ time of the device, that is to say it’s the number of seconds that you iPhone has been active. However, it’s more sneaky than that as putting your device in standby mode will actually leave the device ‘active’ for a few minutes whilst core components are turned off. In effect, if you are relying on mach_absolute_time() and, by extension, CACurrentMediaTime(), you’ll find that the ticks suddenly pause when your iDevice has been in standby for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did this come to light? My game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, required a way to count time accurately independent of the system clock (which can be changed by the user). &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/22/syncing-the-wallabee-store/&quot;&gt;I built a system&lt;/a&gt; which allowed me to get the time from my server, account for some lag, and then render elements from CoreData at specific times based on what I believed was a steady ticking in seconds. When the app was sent out to my testers, it seemed to work but occassionally putting the device to sleep and then resuming would lead to some odd behaviour; the clock was running slightly behind. I tried replicating this several times to no avail and eventually left it ‘as is’ since it seemed to be occurring very infrequently and there was no way to work out exactly was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the code made it into the App Store, there were a few more people commenting that the Store seemed to be running a few seconds behind (or in some cases, minutes behind). I again ran some builds and couldn’t find any errors and it was only after considering that my Xcode build and Testflight build (read “Ad Hoc”) could be different that I discovered the error; any build that wasn’t tethered to my laptop suffered from a slowing down of time. As the Store automatically corrects itself at ~8 minute intervals, and the bug only presented itself after a few minutes of standby, it was quite tricky to replicate exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test it, I built a very crude mockup app that would present a UIAlertView when you came back from standby mode with the number of seconds perceived by CACurrentMediaTime() and the number of seconds derived from deducting two NSDates (which we couldn’t do in the production app as changing the system clock alters that - it’s good for testing though). Sure enough, after leaving the app in the background whilst the device was on standby for a few minutes, it was apparent that CACurrentMediaTime() was pausing. I did another mockup including mach_absolute_time() and that returned the same result; a pausing of the clock when the device was in standby for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of googling, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/shell_cmds/shell_cmds-56/w/w.c&quot;&gt;I found a solution&lt;/a&gt; that was based on the device uptime rather than an arbitrary ‘absolute’ time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-objc&quot; data-lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;time_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;uptime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timeval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boottime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CTL_KERN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;KERN_BOOTTIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;size_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boottime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;time_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;time_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uptime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sysctl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boottime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boottime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tv_sec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uptime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boottime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tv_sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returns a &lt;em&gt;t_time&lt;/em&gt; (read &lt;em&gt;int&lt;/em&gt;) of the number of seconds since the device was last powered up and so I was able to slot this into my old code in place of CACurrentMediaTime().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story? Always test on an Ad Hoc build that isn’t tethered to Xcode. It’s a pain but the crucial thing in this was that the Xcode debugger was keeping the iPhone alive and that meant I was never able to see that CACurrentMediaTime() was pausing itself. The other thing to do is to read Apple documentation carefully. At no point do they specifically say that mach_absolute_time is based on uptime or that it counts up sequentially, but forum posts and other developers blogs had created that perception based on their own findings and those of the method on OS X. It always pays to be careful and understand fully the methods you are calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately (or not), there was a bug with iOS 5 in the version of WallaBee that was submitted to the App Store and so this fix was bundled in with an expedited review. Of course, that update has now been ‘In Review’ for over 24 hours so we’re not out of the woods yet but at least I’m now using a timer that actually counts up…&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/22/syncing-the-wallabee-store/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It turns out CACurrentMediaTime() has a significant bug in that it doesn’t count up when an iPhone is in standby mode. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/29/ca-current-media-time/&quot;&gt;Check this update&lt;/a&gt; for a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve played &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; you’ll know that one of the key areas of the app is the Store, a place where you can buy items with the app currency you collect. The Store has a 3 x 4 grid of items with a timer under each; when the timer runs out, a new item is displayed for purchase. This all sounds straightforward, but when the WallaBee API started getting 3 million hits per day, the Store was one of the first areas to suffer. In this article, I want to run through a few of the problems I experienced when building it the first time, and go into details on the improvements I’ve just added in v1.1.5 of the app which will be available this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2013/01/store.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The WallaBee Store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-original-plan&quot;&gt;The Original Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the Store was going to be fairly simple. It had to be the same for everybody so I’d set up a CRON job that would populate a database table with the upcoming items. Every minute, a check would be performed and items would be added to make sure there was something in every spot until the next time the script ran. Every item had a start and end time that was fixed but had a random amount of seconds (between 10 and 45) so that each item would ‘run out’ at different times. Whenever a player visted the Store, an API call would retrieve the items at each position and do some basic math to work out how long it would be until the position needed to be restocked. Finally, there was an API call to reload just a single position which would be called when an item ran out and a new one was needed. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that WallaBee became popular and the database bore the brunt when a new item was released and the players descended on the Store. This meant that, when a position needed restocking, there could be thousands of requests in the same second all asking the database to tell them what that item should be. Those kinds of numbers don’t work well (it’s basically a denial of service attack) and so the Store would gradually become emptier and emptier as the network activity indicator struggled and the database slowly spat out what items should be where. Another issue was timing; there was a slight overlap between expiration and start times of items and so clever developers could look and work out when a new item was appearing in the Store upto 15 seconds before the item appeared (leading to an unfair advantage). In addition, if the network connection was slow, some players could be behind the live Store by 10 seconds or so meaning they would be at a disadvantage when something new appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly there was work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems&quot;&gt;The Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had three key problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Store had to be synced for everybody. I wouldn’t accept more than a 500ms gap between players regardless of their connection speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It had to be secure with no chance of seeing what item was coming in advance, even if you sniffed the network traffic with something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesproxy.com&quot;&gt;Charles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It needed to be fast. This meant no database calls and as few API calls as possible, especially during peak times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the solution needed to be scalable as I would be adding multiple stores in the next major version of the app. The app would have to be able to display around 80 items at a time rather than 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-plan&quot;&gt;The New Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was that the server would generate a physical file every minute that showed all of the updates for the next 10 minutes. When a device requested the Store, it would download this file (no database calls) along with a synchronisation timestamp. This file would be unpacked on the device and each item would be stored locally so that the Store could continue on without making any network calls. At some random point before the 10 minutes was up, the device would request the next 10 minutes worth of data and unpack it silently in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it sounded good on paper, it would require a lot of work to get everything working correctly. Each piece is inter-connected but I’ll try and explain the general timeline of how it works along with a bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;store-generation&quot;&gt;Store Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that needs to happen is that the server has to generate 10 minutes worth of items. I created a new table that would hold the item objects and wrote a basic CRON job that went through each position and randomly chose an item&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:random&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:random&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; along with a random shelf life between 45 seconds and 4 minutes. This runs every minute and ensures that there is always 10 minutes worth of items coming up. A separate CRON job then runs and compiles these items into a single JSON file which is then encrypted with a military grade cipher (more on that shortly). This file is stored locally and updated every minute. The end result is that you can request the file at any time and always be sure that you have the next 10 minutes worth of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encryption&quot;&gt;Encryption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key things I wanted to ensure was that the Store was secure as I wouldn’t want anybody to sniff the network traffic and see that a new item was coming out in 7 minutes time (it should always be a surprise). To that end, the file is encrypted using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&quot;&gt;AES-256&lt;/a&gt; before being encoded in Base64 for easy transporting. To do this in PHP is fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$json = json_encode($output);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$offset = 16 - (strlen($json) % 16);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$key = ‘YOURPASSWORDHERE’ . str_repeat(chr(0x00), 16);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$data = $json . str_repeat(chr($offset), $offset);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$encryptedData = base64_encode(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $data, &amp;#39;cbc&amp;#39;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that most people miss off is the padding as the data to encrypt has to be a multiple of 16 characters and the characters you use for the padding follow a specific rule; they use the character code of the number of characters you need to pad (for example, if you have to use 7 characters of padding, you’d do it with 7 x chr(7). Another key thing was to use ‘cbc’ as the mode as the default ‘ecb’ found on many tutorials doesn’t work well on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of iOS, decrypting this file is fairly simple using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlanQuatermain/aqtoolkit/tree/master/CommonCrypto&quot;&gt;NSData Category from the CommonCrypto section of aqtoolkit&lt;/a&gt;; it’ll be decoded into NSData which can then be turned into an NSString before using the native JSON library to convert it into an NSDictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-synchronisation&quot;&gt;Time Synchronisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key feature that needed to be implemented was that the iOS device should be synced to the server time so that all players would be shown the items at the correct times; we don’t want players to be behind or ahead even though the API would stop anybody from purchasing an item that isn’t released yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into a number of options for time syncing but many of them use the built-in clock on the iPhone. This is no good as a player could simply advance their clock manually to see future items. Instead I opted to have the main Store file return a Unix timestamp of the time of the request. This is simple in PHP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;$_SERVER[&amp;#39;REQUEST_TIME&amp;#39;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with this is that the time of the request will vary depending on how slow the uplink connection is on the device, and we need a way of accurately monitoring how long it took to download so we can add an offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit&quot;&gt;MKNetworkKit&lt;/a&gt; for my iOS networking needs (although I’m planning on switching to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking&quot;&gt;AFNetworking&lt;/a&gt; in the next release) and it provides a useful block-based method on network operations called onUploadProgressChanged. This provides a double which tells you, as a percentage, how much of your upload is done. When it gets to 1.0, that means you have successfully ‘hit’ the API which should tally up to the $_SERVER[‘REQUEST_TIME’] on the server side&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:accuracy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:accuracy&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know exactly what time we hit the server, we need to start some form of timer so we can see how long it takes until the download completes. To do this, we use CACurrentMediaTime()&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mediatime&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mediatime&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This returns a CFTimeInterval which is roughly the amount of time since your device was rebooted; think of it as a UNIX timestamp that resets every time you start up your phone. I get the current media time upon the successful upload completion, and when the download is complete I get it again and subtract the difference (so I can see, for instance, that the download has taken 572.42ms). We then add this to the timestamp retrieved from the server to get the current server time; we’re now in sync!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rendering-the-ui&quot;&gt;Rendering the UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the next 10 minutes worth of items stored locally and we know the exact server time, now we just need to render the UI. To do this, we’ll need a timer that runs continuously in the background to tell us what the current time is; we use this to get our items from our local store and render the progress bars underneath each shelf. The obvious choice is NSTimer, but there are a few gotchas. Firstly, if you create an NSTimer which is targetting ‘self’, you’ll create a retain loop; the view controller will never be released until the timer is invalidated&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:nstimer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:nstimer&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Secondly, I’m using a UIScrollView with the store and any touches caused the NSTimer to pause (which may account for the time discrepency in older versions). To fix that, you need to add your timer to the main run loop as so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-objc&quot; data-lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_tickTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_tickTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;invalidate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tickTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;userInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;repeats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSRunLoop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainRunLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;addTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_tickTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;forMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NSRunLoopCommonModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a timer that ticks every second but I found it important to use our old friend CACurrentMediaTime() again rather than incrementing a timestamp. The reason for this is that the user may switch tabs, receive a phone call, or leave the app. In those situations, you need to be ready to resume when they come back and, presuming that they’re within the window of how much data you have loaded, you can just kick off without reloading everything. The problem is, if you increment the timer every tick, you’ll start deviating from the start time if you jump back and forth between tabs as the timestamp is always rounded. By storing the CACurrentMediaTime() and the original timestamp when you start your first timer, you can be 100% accurate on your times by working out the number of seconds between now and the original CACurrentMediaTime() and adding them to your timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every ‘tick’ we need to update the UI. This is fairly straightforward and is a case of looking at each position, working out the percentage remaining, and applying that to the progress bar. When an item is due to run out, simply fade it out a second before it expires and on the next tick fade it back in. This leads to seamless animations where before there was a fade out, network request, then gradual fade in. The results were so stark in comparison that I had to slow down the change animation as, without the network lag, it was too quick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final improvement I made was that the ‘ticks’ only happen when you are viewing the Store. Previously, the Store would continuously update in the background (including network requests) leading to a waste of CPU and battery life and making the rest of the app feel sluggish. Now, as soon as you navigate away, the timer is invalidated and nothing is updated. When you come back, the UI is refreshed and the timer is restarted (accurately as mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing we need to remember to do periodically is update our local store. When the Store is first loaded, I choose a random time between 6 and 9 minutes to perform an update. This is to try and spread out the number of requests to the Store file as typically we get 50x more users online when a new item comes out. If they all reloaded the Store at the exact same times we’d have hundreds of API requests in the same second still (admittedly it’s less of an issue as they aren’t hitting the database but it pays to spread the load). If the network connection fails or there is a server problem, the Store will try and reload after 5 seconds until such a time that it gets data. Crucially, the Store will keep going until it runs out of items at which point it stays bare until it gets back on track. To account for any deviations, the time sync is also performed on these updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Store is far superior to the old one in every way. The server is more stable, the data is more secure, and the UI is much snappier. With the changes to the way the Store UI was rendered, the rest of the app feels faster as well and load on the server during peak times should be substantially reduced. Crucially, an issue that has been present for a while with crashes when switching between apps has finally been resolved now that the NSTimer code has been rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a journey getting to this point but I’ve enjoyed learning about time syncing, encryption, and keeping time on iOS. As with many things, this is a progressive update and is a reminder that there is always more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:random&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ok, when I say “randomly chose an item” it’s a bit more complex than that. Items are weighted based on release time, set, pricing, and so on and there are a number of custom overrides (i.e. Christmas is weighted down so you hardly see those items whilst the One Set To Rule Them All is weighted up as it is a huge collection and takes people longer to complete). In future versions, there will be multiple stores that each have their own rules (i.e. there might be a Store which only has items that are over 6 months old or only items from a particular series of sets). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:random&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:accuracy&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s not exact but it’s within ~200ms which is accurate enough for this. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:accuracy&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:mediatime&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;CACurrentMediaTime() is specifically designed for gaming where you need to have time independent of the system clock and that doesn’t need to be reconciled with an actual world time. For example, the early versions of Tiny Tower had a bug in which you could move your system clock forward in order to get around things like “wait 3 hours for restocking”. They now start a CACurrentMediaTime() when you open the app and this is used to track time.. every second, it is checked and the overall time spent is worked out so it knows when 3 hours has passed, not when the timezone says 3 hours has passed. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mediatime&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:nstimer&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I hadn’t realised this in the previous version and I had an NSTimer for each position of the Store! This lead to a large number of unexplained crashes as memory ran out. Lesson learned. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:nstimer&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve wanted to do this year is to finally finish a few of the games I have lying around and publish a few short reviews of them. I’m not going to bother giving them a score but I will give an overview, a few pros and cons, and my final verdict which should boil down to whether you should buy it or not. I’ll only review games that I have either completed or abandoned (if they were that bad). I’ve just completed playing ‘LEGO: Lord of the Rings’ on the Xbox 360 so I’ll start there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LEGO games have been a big success over the past few years starting with ‘LEGO: Star Wars’ nearly 8 years ago. I first started playing them around 4 years ago with ‘LEGO: Harry Potter (Years 1-4)’ and instantly fell in love with a game that is fundamentally about collecting things. Sure you get to go around and smash stuff up (and very occassionally build things) but the basic aim is to collect special bricks, characters, and other unlockables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘LEGO: Lord of the Rings’ (I’m just going to call it LOTR from now on) is no different but they have mixed things up in several ways. Firstly, the graphics are much improved on older LEGO titles with decent shading, textures, and shadows. I had doubts after playing ‘LEGO: Batman 2’ (the most recent title prior to this one) as that game was generally made up of dark areas with an irritating jagged rain effect and looked terrible. Luckily LOTR doesn’t suffer from that problem. Also similar to ‘LEGO: Batman 2’ is the inclusion of proper voice acting for the characters. In previous LEGO games, the characters would mumble and use a mixture of gestures, props, and expressions to get the point across. Whilst this could be a lot of fun, it could be confusing if you weren’t intimately familiar with the plots they were acting out. Several people had doubts about giving the LEGO cast voices but it actually works incredibly well, particularly as they are using the voice recordings from the films (although I noticed a lot of them weren’t from the published films so may be from the cutting room floor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big change is the inclusion of a roaming world. Rather than having a central hub area (Port Royal in Pirates of the Caribbean, Hogwarts in Harry Potter, Gotham City in Batman), you are free to traverse the entirity of Middle Earth. You can walk from The Shire to Mordor (there’s a predictable achievement if you do it as Boromir) and simply activate the 18 plot levels as and when you get to key areas. The scale and depth is absolutely perfect and you’ll be wandering around for hours between levels as you get sidelined by shiny objects in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of getting sidelined, LOTR includes a new feature in the form of quests. As you walk around Middle Earth, you’ll encounter random characters who need a specific item. Your job is to retrieve it for them in return for either a Mithril or Red Brick (there are 250 Mithril Bricks to collect that can be used to forge new items and there are 20 Red Bricks that function as cheats such as 2x multipliers on studs, the game currency). Unfortunately, as the quests aren’t part of the films, they have drafted in some pretty bad voice acting for these sections. It is a great addition though and makes getting the Red Bricks slightly harder than in previous games. The items you can collect sometimes have a useful property as they will generally mimic some character skill. For example, one of Frodo’s skills is that he can use the Light of Eärendil to illuminate areas you couldn’t otherwise explore, but there are several items that also perform that task. Any character can use the items you’ve collected in Free Play mode (a mode where you play a level with any characters and items you’ve unlocked) which means that you can access hidden collectibles without necessarily having unlocked the appropriate character. I tended to always unlock the characters so never really used the item system, but there are a few places where you are forced to such as when you are Frodo wearing The Ring on the Amon Hen level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to walk around all of Middle Earth with seamless transitions between key locations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full voice acting provided by the film cast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New quest system adds some extra challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An incredible number of different abilities across characters (my favourite is definitely Gimli; you have to toss him to break certain walls).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of the key scenes from the films acted out in LEGO form (Helm’s Deep is simply stunning).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good number of non-plot achievements i.e. “They’ve taken the hobbits to Isengard” which you unlock by going to Isengard as every playable hobbit (which includes Bilbo and Rosie).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m not really sure if I should list this as a ‘pro’ but there isn’t any online multiplayer. Instead, there is a fantastic 2-player local co-op with an intelligent split-screen and the ability for player 2 to drop in and out at will. I think this is a ‘pro’ as it encourages people to play together rather than via the internet. It also means there aren’t any irritating ‘multiplayer only’ achievements making it perfectly feasible to get 1000g playing solo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 40-60 hours of gameplay to get all achievements and 100% game completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The quest feature isn’t explained very well. I had to look online to work out that you get the items they ask for in the levels, not in Middle Earth (this wasn’t helped by the fact that the first person you meet asking for one tells you the item is ‘on the road’ when it means ‘on the road in that level you just did’).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The voice acting on the item quests is truly awful. Admittedly, the text they’ve got to work with is awful as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing between characters whilst in Middle Earth can be a bit of a pain. You always have 2 characters in play but if you change the 1st one to be the 2nd one, it switches to them rather than changing your character. For example, you have Sam standing in Minas Tirith and you’ve just climbed to the top of the White Tower as Legolas when you realise you need Sam to light the flame. When you go to character selection and change to Sam, it swaps to the other player rather than changing Legolas to Sam. It can also happen randomly if you’ve used the character you want with the other player recently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some of the jumping puzzles when roaming Middle Earth are damn near impossible due to glitchy camera angles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;squee-moments&quot;&gt;Squee Moments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 3 film cameos from Peter Jackson are all in the game (he’s usually holding an Oscar).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tom Bombadil is an unlockable character.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You not only get to fight the Balrog whilst falling in Khazad-dûm (as per the opening of The Two Towers) but you also get to kill him on top of a snowy peak later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should buy this game. Definitely. Like all LEGO games, it appeals to every age group and has a lot more depth than you would think. As a Lord of the Rings fan, I found this to be a stunningly good use of the license rather than a shameless cash-in like a lot of the Lord of the Rings games. It’s evident that the developers working on it were huge fans as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-more-thing&quot;&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I’m talking about LEGO Lord of the Rings, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/92099762@N05/8390728187/in/photostream&quot;&gt;some interesting leaks&lt;/a&gt; online about the second wave of LEGO sets that are due to launch sometime around Q1/2 this year. Practically confirmed so far are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wizard Battle (Gandalf and Saruman)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Council of Elrond&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/92099762@N05/8390693767/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;The Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; (including a Mouth of Sauron minifig)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pirate Ship Ambush&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clickabrick.co.uk/2013/01/10237-tower-of-orthanc-confirmed.html#.UPwcZqWIFcw&quot;&gt;The Tower of Orthanc&lt;/a&gt; - Oh. Hell. Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-lord-of-the-rings-2013-set-rumors/&quot;&gt;also rumours&lt;/a&gt; of a Treebeard and Balrog set - there haven’t been any leaked images of these so we’ll see but a LEGO Balrog has been on a lot of wishlists since the license was first announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I think I’m going to attempt to build this &lt;a href=&quot;http://leonardoslegos.blogspot.co.uk/p/project-lego-tower-of-orthanc.html&quot;&gt;fan-made 1.8 metre high Tower of Orthanc&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting news from &lt;a href=&quot;http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2013/01/taking-the-disney-guest-experience-to-the-next-level/&quot;&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Linking the entire MyMagic+ experience together is an innovative piece of technology we developed called the MagicBand. Worn on the wrist, it will serve as a guest’s room key, theme park ticket, access to FastPass+ selections, PhotoPass card and optional payment account all rolled into one. We’ve began testing certain aspects of MyMagic+ in Florida last month and the early reactions we’ve gotten have been fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, if you stay at a Walt Disney World Resort (which you really should), you get a plastic card which acts as a room card, charge card, dining plan card, and theme park ticket. It can also be used on their cruise ship to access your room and make purchases if you add that to your holiday. With this update, they’re giving all guests an RFID wristband which they can then use for the same things as well as verifing FastPass tickets (no more annoying paper receipts) and using the PhotoPass service. It’s a great new feature and I can’t wait to see it roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it sounds like they’re making an iOS app that you’ll be able to book dinner reservations and, more exciting, FastPass tickets through. It’s going to be a good year to go to Walt Disney World!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been neglecting this website of late as I’ve been working fulltime on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; for the past few months. However, I’m currently available for a short (&amp;lt; 3 month) freelance iOS contract or project ideally on a remote basis although I can obviously travel for key meetings, etc. If you have something you think may be of interest, then &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be getting around to updating this website more fully at some point but you can always follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpha.app.net/bendodson&quot;&gt;App.net&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or read my personal blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/&quot;&gt;bendodson.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Passwords and Encryption</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/06/passwords-and-encryption/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2013/01/06/passwords-and-encryption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’d been thinking for a while that my password setup wasn’t particularly secure; a fairly basic 10 character password with a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, and some digits that I used on every website and rarely changed (maybe once a year). I’d been reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; but could never really be bothered to make the switch. I had some spare time over the Christmas holidays so I finally got around to changing over to a much more secure system. This entry is a roundup of the process I went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-a-password-manager&quot;&gt;Using a password manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do was switch to a system of having a different password for every website. The reason for this is that a single breach of one account will lead to vulnerabilities in the others (and there are a lot of websites and apps out there that store your password in an unencrypted form). Each password should also be very secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you really need a password manager; an app that will store all of your passwords for you. After a bit of research, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; to be the most suitable for my needs. As well as storing passwords, it can also generate secure passwords (easily variable by length and number of digits and symbols) and store items such as license keys and credit card numbers. There is also a companion iOS app (very important) with cloud syncing and you can even open the database securely on other machines as the file itself has a web version of the app built in! The main thing though is that it is incredibly secure. I have a lot of trust for a company that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/07/31/1password-is-ready-for-john-the-ripper/&quot;&gt;willing to publish exactly how they store passwords&lt;/a&gt; and can reliabily demonstrate how difficult it would be to crack (not impossible, but incredibly difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/downloads/1Password/Mac&quot;&gt;30 day trial of the Mac app&lt;/a&gt; and came across my first decision; what to use for a master password? The core database is secure from automated attacks so the weakest link is going to be the password I choose for it. Obviously I shouldn’t use a basic password as I had before but it needs to be something I can remember (but not be directly related to me - after all, you’re most likely to be hacked by people that know you). Enter an excellent password generation system called &lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html&quot;&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt;, a completely random way of creating a password. It works by giving you a list of words with a 5-digit code next to each one. You roll 5 six-sided dice and the result is your first word (i.e. if you rolled 1,6,3,2,2 then you’d look up 16322 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc&quot;&gt;Diceware wordlist&lt;/a&gt; and come up with ‘celia’. You repeat this process until you have a string of random words such that you get a password like ‘celia autumn well stern romeo veil’. As they are based on real words, you can remember them quite easily by linking them as a sentence or story. For additional security, you can mix it with your own system of punctuation or spacing so you end up with a possibility such as ‘Celia Autumn. well stern. Romeo:veil’ which would be a difficult password to crack but not too bad to remember. If you don’t like the idea of using a list such as Diceware, you could choose random words from a book with dice to choose the page number, line number, and word. For more ideas and an indepth look at generating a secure master password, read “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.agilebits.com/2011/06/21/toward-better-master-passwords/&quot;&gt;Toward Better Master Passwords&lt;/a&gt;” from the AgileBits blog (I’d also recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/936/&quot;&gt;xkcd comic on password strength&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a master password chosen, I found it beneficial to type it out 50 times to get my fingers used to it. I had no problem remembering my password after that so I never had to write it down anywhere, something which may be a good idea for helping you to remember for the first few days but just seems a bit lax to me. Next, I went through the websites I used most often and updated their passwords with newly generated ones. I’m still stumbling across websites that I haven’t updated so I just make sure to create a new password for any website when I next use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I purchased the iOS app and set up syncing via Dropbox. This ensures that I can always access the core database i.e. from another machine. The iOS app works very well and whilst it can be a pain to have to type in my mammoth password and then copy / paste whenever I want to do something such as purchasing an app, I deem it a worthwhile inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 weeks of using 1Password, I’ve found it to be an incredibly useful solution. I assumed that the hassle of typing in my master password to get to my other passwords would be a hassle but overall I’m actually faster at accessing sites than before. This is mainly because I have different email addresses or usernames for each website or account. That information is now stored along with the password so I never enter the wrong details (or have to go through the time consuming ‘recover password’ options). I tried using the Safari extension for a while (which enables automatic form population) but ultimately found this to be distracting (prompting when I didn’t want it to) so uninstalled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encrypting-insecure-apps&quot;&gt;Encrypting insecure apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was on a security warpath, I decided to try and do something about securing apps that have very poor or no built-in security. The main two offenders for me are &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com&quot;&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jumsoft.com/money/&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; both of which store their (sensitive) data in a completely accessible format. Whilst Day One does provide a password option, that is just for the app; you can read the XML files directly from the hard drive. As I store both of these databases in Dropbox (for easy syncing and backup), I wanted something a bit more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/knox&quot;&gt;Knox&lt;/a&gt; which happens to be made by  AgileBits, the same people behind 1Password. Knox is an encryption utility that allows you to create secure ‘vaults’. These vaults are secured by password and when unlocked take the form of a mounted disk image. You can put anything you want in them, and when you eject them they become a single encrypted file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my setup, I created a new vault for each app, secured it with a ridiculously secure password (stored in 1Password), and then moved the database for each app into the mounted vault. Whenever I want to use the app, I unlock the appropriate vault and then launch the app from the vault itself. Once I’ve added my diary entry or transactions, I quit the app, and then close down Knox. The advantage to this is that if you open up either app without the vault unlocked, it can’t find the database so it creates a new one (meaning anyone trying to look at my transactions will just get a blank app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue I had with this set up is that I didn’t want to store the raw database files in iCloud or Dropbox (I do keep the Knox vault files in Dropbox though). This means that I lose the option to sync with a companion device so I can’t update Day One or Money via their companion iOS apps. This is more frustrating for Money (as I’m more likely to want to add a transaction at the point of purchase) but isn’t a dealbreaker for my usage. I’d rather have my transaction history secure and accessible on one machine than insecure and synced on all my devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;locking-down-my-laptop&quot;&gt;Locking down my laptop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing for me to do was to increase the security on my MacBook which I use as my main machine. OS X has a lot of built-in security options that aren’t enabled by default. The first one I enabled was ‘FileVault’ which automatically encrypts your hard drive. The issue with it is that if you forget your main OS X password then there is no recovery for the files on the machine unless you have a special code that you are given at the time of enabling. I stored this in 1Password for extra security but as everything important in my machine is backed up on Dropbox (and also via Time Machine which you can also encrypt) I don’t feel it’s a big issue for the extra security it affords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other setting I enabled was ‘Empty Trash Securely’ which you can enable in ‘Finder Preferences’. This basically performs a government style wipe on files as they are deleted from Trash meaning they are effectively shredded rather than just deleted. Emptying the Trash takes longer as a result but, again, it’s a worthwhile trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, 1Password obviously can’t store my MacBook login (as you can only access it when logged in unless you visually copied it from an iOS device each time) so I needed to choose a new secure password for that. In my opinion, the password should be different to the 1Password master password but just as secure so Diceware combined with personal alterations is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new set up is obviously much more secure than what I was doing previously but I was struck by one fairly big problem; password resets. For instance, my Amazon password is very secure (so secure I don’t even know what it is) but it can be reset by answering security questions which are usually of the order of date of birth and Mother’s maiden name. By their very nature, a security question is a very personal thing (“what was your first pets name?”) so anybody that knows me (or can do a basic Google search) would be able to reset my accounts. That is partly how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/&quot;&gt;Mat Honan of Wired&lt;/a&gt; was successfully hacked last August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best defence (in my opinion) against something like that is to fudge the security questions. If you accept the premise that your 1Password account is secure, then you don’t have need for the security questions (as you’ll never lose the password) so you should just fill them in with rubbish. Alternatively, create lies that you store in your 1Password account. If a website forces you to store something like “first pets name” then choose a random word from the Diceware list (i.e. ‘Celia’) and note that down against the account in 1Password. This is particularly useful for over-the-phone accounts (i.e. trying to reset iCloud) as anybody trying to breach your account will think they know the correct answer (my first pet was called ‘Chip’ to save you searching) but you’ve outsmarted them with a lie. When you need to verify yourself, you can simply look up the ‘correct’ answer from your secure 1Password database. As AgileBits point out ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.agilebits.com/2011/06/21/toward-better-master-passwords/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;there are more ways to lie than to tell the truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is ever going to be 100% secure, but these new changes should significantly reduce the chances of having my data or identity stolen. Hopefully the steps I’ve outlined above will make you think about how you are securing your information and help make you a bit more secure this year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/12/29/dryathlon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I saw an advert in GQ which caught my eye; the nation’s first “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dryathlon.org/&quot;&gt;Dryathlon&lt;/a&gt;”. Created by Cancer Research UK, the idea is to give up alcohol for the month of January in order to raise money to help beat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost several family and friends to cancer so I decided to accept the challenge and give up all drinking in January. As many of you will know, I enjoy the odd bottle or three of red wine; by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dryathlon.org.uk&quot;&gt;calculator on their website&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out that I spend around £198 per month on alcohol so I’ll be donating that amount to the fund at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’ve made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/dryathlete-simon-wicks&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/dryathlete-alan-shaw&quot;&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; join in and we’ve had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/blog/2012/12/29/dryathlon/&quot;&gt;custom item designed&lt;/a&gt; that can only be obtained by making a donation. The item will be available on a donation-only basis for 2 weeks or until we hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/teams/wallabee/&quot;&gt;our team target&lt;/a&gt; of £1000. After that point, it will be available in our Store for 10,000hc until the end of January; for every one of those items purchased, we’ll be donating an extra £1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal target is to raise £500 for Cancer Research so, if you are able to, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/dryathlete-ben-dodson&quot;&gt;making a donation&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll buy you a drink in February…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/dryathlete-ben-dodson&quot;&gt;Donate Now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cleaning Up My Web Presence</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/12/28/cleaning-up-my-web-presence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2012 23:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/12/28/cleaning-up-my-web-presence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/&quot;&gt;BenDodson.com&lt;/a&gt; for 6 years. It originally started as a website to showcase my portfolio whilst doing some freelance work and slowly grew into a blog about web development, coding, and eventually iOS and general Apple speculation. Last year, I decided I wanted to split out into having separate personal and professional websites and so the content was moved to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bendodsonapps.com/&quot;&gt;BenDodsonApps.com&lt;/a&gt; and this site became a standard Wordpress blog for me to post various bits and pieces that interested me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I’ve never really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is too bloated for what I need and was only chosen because it’s easy to get templates for it. I haven’t updated the blog in ages purely because I don’t like the layout or design and couldn’t build up the enthusiasm to change it when I had far more pressing things to do. A few days off at Christmas seemed like the perfect opportunity to change that so today I’ve built the new BenDodson.com; I’ve ditched Wordpress for a static HTML 5 site compiled from Markdown files with Jekyll (read more about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;/colophon/&quot;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;) and the design has been stripped back to be purely about the text. In addition, all previous content has been removed (my very old posts are still available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bendodsonapps.com/&quot;&gt;BenDodsonApps.com&lt;/a&gt;) so that I can have a clean break on a new weblog. It’s intended to be a place for longer posts on topics that interest me (everything from why I hate android to why I love LEGO) as well as a place for interesting links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started on the new site, I sat down and took stock of all the places that I have a “web presence” with a view to working out a better way to do things going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current line up (and proposed plan) is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-private&quot;&gt;Personal (Private)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; - A necessary evil and a way to stay in touch with family and close friends. If I haven’t met you in person, you won’t be on my Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day One&lt;/strong&gt; - My private journal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-public&quot;&gt;Personal (Public)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/&quot;&gt;BenDodson.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This website, a personal blog devoted to the topics that interest me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alpha.app.net/bendodson/&quot;&gt;App.net (@BenDodson)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Microblog that I’ll use to post random thoughts (and links) to on an increasingly infrequent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;Twitter (@BenDodson)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This will simply syndicate whatever is on App.net but it’s a good way for people to get in touch. I expect to stop using Twitter by the end of 2013 in favour of App.net.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I stopped using Flickr a while back (and I don’t have a decent camera so it’ll stay deactivated for a while) so this is a good stopgap for sharing photos taken from my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I’m planning on deactivating this as I don’t share my location much these days. Maybe 2013 will be the year that I finally build the Gowalla successor that everyone has asked me to. We’ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;business&quot;&gt;Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bendodsonapps.com/&quot;&gt;BenDodsonApps.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - My professional website with my portfolio and work-orientated blog. Will be getting an update soon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tubeupdates.com/&quot;&gt;TubeUpdates.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - My TubeUpdates API. Might discontinue this at some point soon as TfL provide something similar these days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikilocation.org/&quot;&gt;WikiLocation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - My WikiLocation API. No plans to discontinue this as it doesn’t take up much of my time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodsonapps/&quot;&gt;Twitter (@BenDodsonApps)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ve not posted anything on this for months but may start it up again as @BenDodson becomes more personal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/wikilocation/&quot;&gt;Twitter (@WikiLocation)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Yet another Twitter account that doesn’t get many posts (mainly because WikiLocation doesn’t get updated very often). I think this will get merged into @BenDodsonApps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a lot of accounts and I’m sure I’m missing some of the other things that I’ve stopped using like Last.fm, Flickr, and Tumblr. This also doesn’t include all of the WallaBee social sites that I run such as Twitter (one for the app, one for the APIs), App.net, Google+, Facebook, and Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve noticed most over the past 6 years is that people really don’t give a shit about what other people are doing; they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that people care about what they’re doing though. The ‘lifestream’ was all the rage when I started this site and I naively signed up for every new service and posted everything I was doing in the misguided belief that people actually bothered reading it. As we come to the end of 2012, I’ve realised that there is far too much crap on the internet that I just don’t care about, and I’ve been adding to it by checking in on everything from places to music to wine and everything inbetween. That’s why I’ve taken a good look at my web presence and attempted to strip it back to work and pleasure. Microblogging is going on the back burner and I’ll be partaking in a lot less “social” networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, BenDodson.com will be a more wordy diary type affair with entries that reflect my mood and opinion. We’ll see how long it lasts…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone apps on the new iPad</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/16/iphone-apps-on-the-new-ipad/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/16/iphone-apps-on-the-new-ipad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a new iPad today (along with a 1080p Apple TV) and whilst I don’t want to review it in detail (there are plenty of other reviews) I will say that the screen is absolutely incredible. Whilst most 3rd party apps are not retina-ready yet, those that are look stunning. I actually used my iPad to answer my emails today as it looked so much crisper than my iMac!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one of the things that has interested me is how iPhone apps would look on the new iPad. Bearing in mind that there are 4x as many pixels, I assumed that Apple would use retina versions of iPhone apps scaled up. As you might recall, the original iPad and iPad 2 would use regular iPhone apps and scale them rather than using the retina equivelants (something &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/10/does-ios-5-finally-allow-retina-display-iphone-apps-to-run-unscaled-on-the-ipad/&quot;&gt;I’ve written about before&lt;/a&gt;). I could understand this for imagery but the keyboard and text looked horrible when scaled making any app that wasn’t a game pretty much unusable at 2x mode on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately this has changed with the new iPad. Apps are stills scaled, but the fonts are much crisper as is the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate, I’ve tested a couple of apps on iOS 5.1 on both the iPad 2 and new iPad and listed some screenshots below. These have been scaled down to fit the page so you will need to click / tap each one to load up the fullsize versions. You won’t notice the difference (aside from some colour improvements) unless you view at fullsize as they look pretty similar when scaled down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new iPad is on the left - iPad 2 is on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iOS 5.1 Location Services Bug</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/14/ios-5-1-location-services-bug/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/14/ios-5-1-location-services-bug/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst using the public version of iOS 5.1 I’ve noticed an interesting bug with one of my apps. &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wallabee/id479211430?mt=8&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt; uses Location Services but as all good apps should it makes a point of stopping location monitoring after a certain amount of inactivity (to save battery) and also when the app goes into the background. Location monitoring starts up again as soon as you go back to the foreground or navigate to a page that will require more precise location monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On iOS 5.0.*, closing the app would lead to the Location Services indicator disappearing immediately. On iOS 5.1, Location Services stays active for ~10 seconds after it’s been told explicitly to stop monitoring. Initially I thought this might be a problem with the code I’d written but, after some testing on multiple devices and with multiple apps, it turns out this is an issue that affects all location based apps on iOS 5.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t really a big issue but it is fairly annoying, particularly as some apps do keep monitoring your location in the background so you end up trying to work out what is still running only to realise it’s the OS not giving up when it should do. It’s particularly annoying as an app developer - v1.0.3 of WallaBee came out on the day iOS 5.1 was released and I’ve now had 3 enquries as to why Location Services is less efficient in the new version (whereas it’s actually much more efficient in the app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of why iOS 5.1 is doing this, I can only assume that Location Services is told to turn off after the full amount of background task allowance has been used. If an app doesn’t ask to run in the background, it has around 10 seconds after being closed to do any tidying up (i.e. saving documents, closing network connections) before the OS forcably terminates it. This seems to be the case with Location Services as if you close the app and then force quit, the service is stopped (suggesting ownership is with the app, not the OS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably an oversight on Apple’s part (as I can’t think of a good reason why this would be built-in) but I thought I’d put up a post on the issue for any other developers who run into the problem and for anyone using my apps and wondering why Location Services is still active once the app is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The curious case of "the new iPad"</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The strangest thing that happened at the iPad announcement last week turned out not to be the lack of Siri, presence of a home button, or uninteresting iOS 5.1 update, but instead the name; “the new iPad” rather than the universally predicted “iPad 3” (or late runner “iPad HD”). Based on this news, most people seem to think that there is a convergence with other product names in that everything will end up as just “iPad”, “MacBook Air”, “iPod Nano”, etc. In particular, people are predicting that the iPhone 5 (which would actually be the iPhone 6 - drives me crazy!) will now be launched as “the new iPhone”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried explaining it on Twitter but 140 characters ain’t a lot of room to play with so I thought I’d lay some thoughts out on Apple’s naming conventions in this post. I’ll also try and second guess some of Apple’s future product announcements based purely on naming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPod is the pure example of the new iPad naming philosophy as they have always just been known as individual products. i.e. iPod, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, etc. Every year (pretty much) a new device is launched that immediately replaces the old ones. If you look at something like the iPod Nano, there have now been six of them (all in various shapes and sizes) but you can only ever buy the latest version. In support documents, they are simply referred to by generation i.e. this case will work with “iPod Nano (6th generation)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mac&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mac lineup is slightly different to the iPod lineup in that there are more customisations that can be made. You can change processors, RAM, hard drives, screen sizes, etc but fundamentally there is only one product per line. When a new product is released, the old one is immediately unavailable. The naming is also slightly different - rather than referring to the latest Mac mini as “Mac mini (10th Generation)” it is referred to by date making the latest one “Mac mini (Mid 2011)”. This works because the Mac line can be updated multiple times per year with processor bumps, etc, so it makes sense to refer to its launch date rather than its generation. This is the same naming convention that a lot of Apple’s software uses such as iWork ‘09. Whilst iTunes isn’t named after a year (it’s just a version) you could add “20” in front to make them year based as they have been annual since v8.0 came out in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the future of the Mac lineup, there are currently 5 products; MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iMac, and Mac Pro. I believe that convergence is going to happen on the MacBook Air / Pro lineup as it makes sense that Apple will make the Pro thinner, lighter, and will remove the optical drive. This is further evidenced by the fact that the MacBook itself was removed a while ago leaving the name free. In future, if you want an Apple laptop, you’ll just get “MacBook” - it could be any size from 11”-17” with various configurations but it will be one line. It’s also fairly likely that the Mac Pro will be removed for a slightly beefier iMac leading to just 3 lines; MacBook, Mac mini, iMac. That’s just pure speculation but it makes complete sense to me. If you want portable computing, you choose iPad or MacBook but you choose Mac mini or iMac for desktop computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipad&quot;&gt;iPad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad lineup should have been simple - a single product that gets updated yearly and will always be known as “iPad”. However, Apple threw a spanner in the works by calling the second generation the “iPad 2”. There was no need to do this when the iPad 2 was the same price as the iPad and completely replaced it as per the iPod lineup but now they are stuck with it. By naming the iPad 3 “the new iPad”, it looks like they are trying to go back to that model but there is a big issue with that; the iPad 2 is still available for sale at a $100 discount. In Apple’s defence they’ve done a pretty good job of making this work with the structure of their website showing only “iPad” and then the “iPad 2” is a small button at the bottom. There is also a comparison chart which very quickly shows that “the new iPad” is newer than the “iPad 2”. It’s hardly an ideal situation though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why have they done it? Whilst the iPad 2 could have been completely removed and replaced by the new iPad (which would make the naming all work out nicely) they wanted to keep selling the iPad 2 at a discount as it beats the competition quite nicely. The only real competitor to the iPad has been the Kindle Fire so by making the entry-level iPad slightly cheaper they can appeal to some of the people that might have been stuck choosing between the two. They couldn’t retroactively rename the iPad 2 so they were stuck with the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feeling on this is that the iPad 2 is going to be removed from sale before the end of 2012 and replaced by a smaller form factor (say 8”) and given a new line; “iPad Nano” or “iPad Mini”. This will get Apple to a good place where they have a cheaper iPad and the premium iPad and two simple lines that can be updated in the same way as the iPod lineup. I say this as if the iPad 2 was going to stick around for a full year I think the new iPad would have been called “iPad 2 Pro” as that’s essentially what it is - same form factor, better screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iphone&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the real issue - what will the new iPhone be called. Based on my tweet yesterday, most people think it will be called “the new iPhone” to follow the iPad example. I highly doubt it. The difference with the iPhone to all of Apple’s other products is that they keep selling the old models for up to 2 years. Just look at the lineup now; “iPhone 3GS”, “iPhone 4”, “iPhone 4S”. If the next iPhone is referred to simply as “the new iPhone” then you’ll end up with “iPhone 4”, “iPhone 4S”, “iPhone”. That might work, but in 2013 you’d have “iPhone 4S”, “iPhone”, “iPhone” and that’s where it falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one for Apple and I don’t really have the answer. Let’s take a look at possible names for the next generation iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/em&gt; - it’s the 6th generation iPhone so that won’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/em&gt; - Original, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 6. Doesn’t really work as a numbering system but I wouldn’t rule it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 4G&lt;/em&gt; - yesterday I thought this was a pretty good idea. Then I remembered that iOS 5.1 now refers to HSDPA+ as “4G” so I don’t think this can be used anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone LTE&lt;/em&gt; - it’ll definitely have LTE integrated and iPhone’s have been named after their wireless tech before. However, LTE isn’t available around the world like 3G was so I don’t think they’ll go for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone HD&lt;/em&gt; - no. Just no.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;the new iPhone&lt;/em&gt; - I don’t think they can pull that trick twice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 2012&lt;/em&gt; - maybe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a difficult situation and there is no obvious choice. I can see it going a number of ways though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The long rumoured “iPhone Nano” makes an appearance leading Apple to create just two lines; iPhone and iPhone Nano. iPhone 4/4S won’t be sold at a discount (they’ll just disappear) meaning that Apple can refer to the iPhone 6 as just “iPhone”. I don’t think they can do this if they continue selling the 4/4S though.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone changes to a year numbering system much like the Mac lineup - whilst you would just have “2012” instead of “mid 2012” it might work and allows you to distinguish between multiple versions easily. Not the tidiest of solutions though - “iPhone ‘12” or “iPhone 2012” doesn’t have the same simplicity as “iPhone 6” or “iPhone”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple name it “iPhone LTE” - it might not be available everywhere but at least it distinguishes. Might have an issue in 2013 though - LTES won’t work and there won’t be another wireless technology to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple choose something that isn’t in that list perhaps naming it after a design element with something like “iPhone Curve” (though obviously not “Curve” - RIM would have a fit if they’re still around)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst nearly all of the Apple product line has converged to yearly updates that replace the previous model, the iPad 2 has caused a problem in that it’s still hanging around at a discount. I’m fairly sure this is going to be replaced by a mini or a nano at some point in the near future thus ending this particular story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone, however, is a completely different story and I’m confident that Apple won’t name the next model “the new iPhone” unless they stop selling 3 versions of iPhone at the same time. That is doable (if a new line appears in the way I expect it to for the iPad) but I think it more likely that they will name the next iPhone after something about the device that we don’t know about yet; design, haptic touch, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, time will tell. Apple have a habit of choosing things that you wouldn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing the iPad 3 invite</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/03/analyzing-the-ipad3-invite/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2012 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/03/03/analyzing-the-ipad3-invite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been made in the Apple press recently about the invite to the Apple Media Event on 7th March which is widely expected to introduce the iPad 3. Specifically, the invite appears to show an iPad with an improved screen and no home button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/ipad3-invite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there will be a “Retina Display” in the iPad 3 (I’ll eat my iPad 2 if there isn’t) but the lack of a home button is something that has floated around before, mainly due to the gestures built into iOS 5 that allow you to close apps with a 4/5 finger grab. I only ever use the gestures to get around on my iPad but I don’t really think the home button would be completely removed. For a start it has too many purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closes apps (can be done with a gesture)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lets you access the multi-tasking tray (can also be done with a gesture)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows screenshots to be taken (press at the same time as the power button)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to Siri (on the iPhone 4S at least - one assumes the same will happen in the iPad 3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility shortcuts (triple tap to invert colours for example)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force restart the device (hold at the same time as the power button for a while)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst some of these things could be done in other ways, I just don’t buy the idea that they would remove it - doing things with gestures is great but they are more like keyboard shortcuts for power users than an intuitive way to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, it was obvious to me that the invite was showing an iPad 3 in landscape and I set out to prove this with some judicious screenshotting (thanks home button) and photoshopping. However, it didn’t quite work out as I expected…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Apple have very helpfully used the “bubble” background on the iPad in their invite, it should be quite trivial to work out the placement of the icons by mapping them to the unique bubble clusters in the image. For example. there is a unique cluster next to the calendar icon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/invite-cluster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Bubble Cluster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the invite, we know that there are at least 3 icons showing in the “dock” – Maps, Calendar, and Keynote – and you can only have a maximum of 6 icons. I screenshotted the iPad in both orientations with all the possible combinations of 3, 4, 5, and 6 icons and only one came out close to the bubble layout of the invite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/ipad-portrait.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Mockup - Portrait&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, that scuppered my landscape theory. Let’s take a closer look at the calendar icon when it’s in this formation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/icon-segment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Mockup - Portrait&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also done some basic distortion in photoshop to change the angles so that it matches (roughly) the perspective of the Apple invite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/icon-segment-skewed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Mockup - Portrait&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty confident of the location as it’s one of the only possibilities that causes the page control (the little dots and the search icon) to be cut off when photographed at that angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the two side by side, we can see that the bubble cluster is a pretty good match, but it isn’t exact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/invite-cluster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Bubble Cluster&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/03/mockup-cluster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad 3 Invite Mockup Bubble Cluster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icons in the invite are actually slightly bigger than those on the iPad 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean? I have a number of theories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The iPad 3 has no home button and its icon layout is slightly different&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This isn’t the iPad 3 - it’s a different device (i.e. a 7 inch iPad hence the slightly different icon arrangement)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a photoshopped invite and means nothing - there won’t be any big surprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was a betting man I’d go with option 3. Whilst it’s intriguing to disect these invites to see if they have any deeper meaning, the reality is that it’s probably been photoshopped together with a few mistakes (the bubbles not matching) and something to get the blogosphere worked up (no home button). I highly doubt that the iPad 3 will lose the home button and I have my reservations that a smaller form factor will be announced (despite the fact that I’d prefer a smaller iPad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the announcement, my predictions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPad 3 with “Retina Display” that is 2048x1536 with the same @2x syntax for developers to make their apps compatible. It will be slightly more expensive than the iPad 2 (say an extra $50-70) but the iPad 2 will see a price drop to something like $399 or $429.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple TV with 1080p output (the invite says “something to see” and “something to touch” - Apple TV and iPad 3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated iTunes content to accomodate a 1080p Appple TV and an iPad that is beyond 1080p.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iOS 5.1 with 3rd party Siri APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess we’ll see on March 7th!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/02/16/ive-been-looking-forward-to-this-day-for-a-long-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today has seen the culmination of several months of work and several years of planning. I launched my latest app, &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wallabee/id479211430?mt=8&quot;&gt;WallaBee&lt;/a&gt;, which I like to call “The ultimate collectables game”. It’s a mixup of several ideas from things such as Gowalla, Pokémon, PackRat, and Baseball Trading cards (or Football stickers if you’re in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to do a big post about it now as you can find out all the details at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;wallab.ee&lt;/a&gt; (or just &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wallabee/id479211430?mt=8&quot;&gt;download the app&lt;/a&gt;) but I did want to give a few shout outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this app wouldn’t be possible without &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/al86shaw&quot;&gt;Alan Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/lonelycoo&quot;&gt;Simon Wicks&lt;/a&gt; who have both invested a huge amount of time in this project. They’ve put up with my constant changes and demands as well as suggesting many great ideas that I wouldn’t have come up with on my own. I’m proud to be launching this app with such great co-partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly I’d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://karategraphics.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew Cameron of Karate Grafika&lt;/a&gt; who designed the beautiful icons you’re hopefully collecting today. We spent a lot of time searching for the right designer and we’re overwhelmed with the amount of positive reviews we’ve received for Andy’s work. Andy is the ‘secret sauce’ of our app and we’re very lucky to be working with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ericl&quot;&gt;Eric Longstaff&lt;/a&gt; who has taken on the role of Community Manager and is replying to people on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.wallab.ee&quot;&gt;support forum&lt;/a&gt; almost has quickly as they can submit questions! It’s great to have someone with so much charisma on our team who believes in the project and wants to make sure that everybody else is enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a wild ride getting to this point and I really hope that people see the amount of time and effort we’ve spent in trying to get the little details right. We know that there is further work to be done and we have an ambitious roadmap. Version 1.0.1 (coming soon) will add localisation support for 5 languages and a big v1.1 update at the end of March which will introduce a heap of social features. We are essentially a startup but I want to make it clear that our entire focus is on delighting our players - we’ve invested in the most expensive package GetSatisfaction had so we can keep on top of our community and we’re absolutely committed to getting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have pointed out that we’re just using the ideas of Gowalla and PackRat and putting them together. I want to confront that issue head on. Yes, their are similarities, but we believe the devil is in the detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are focussed on a single thing; items. We have a location database (built up from data aquired from Gowalla for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8&quot;&gt;Highlights app&lt;/a&gt; - incidentally, this database is not a wholesale copy but something that has been carefully curated and augmented with data from a number of other platforms over a period of 12 months) and we allow players and developers to add to this database but it’s not our key focus. We are fundamentally not a check-in service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We don’t just want to build a community of players, we also want to build a community of developers. That’s why we launched 3 full APIs with our app that you can interact with today. These include real time notifications and access to all of our high-resolution item artwork. If you build something on our platform, we’ll promote it. You can find out more in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/developers/&quot;&gt;Developer Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most important thing, the item that is at the core of who we are, is that we are dedicated to the player. We promise to listen, adapt, and make changes that the community wants rather than just blazing our own trail. We will never fundamentally change our product on a whim when we know that it’s not what our community wants. We built this app because it’s the app we wanted to use. We will never deviate from that course or that core belief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy using WallaBee. It’s been my dream for the past few years and, whilst this this is just the start,  I treasure it as the biggest moment of my career.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some great finds by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mclov.in/&quot;&gt;Arun Thampi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Upon inspecting closer, I noticed that my entire address book (including full names, emails and phone numbers) was being sent as a plist to Path. Now I don’t remember having given permission to Path to access my address book and send its contents to its servers, so I created a completely new “Path” and repeated the experiment and I got the same result – my address book was in Path’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wondered how Path managed to match me up so quickly to my friends when the only thing I’d given it was my email address. Turns out that it uploads your entire phone book and then matches names / email addresses to give you recommendations. It’s incredibly slick, but it is a privacy concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mclov.in/2012/02/08/path-uploads-your-entire-address-book-to-their-servers.html#dsq-comment-432202082&quot;&gt;The CEO of Path replied&lt;/a&gt; to the post with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arun, thanks for pointing this out. We actually think this is an important conversation and take this very seriously. We upload the address book to our servers in order to help the user find and connect to their friends and family on Path quickly and effeciently as well as to notify them when friends and family join Path. Nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We believe that this type of friend finding &amp;amp; matching is important to the industry and that it is important that users clearly understand it, so we proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago and are rolling out the opt-in for this in 2.0.6 of our iOS Client, pending App Store approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they are going to make it opt-in but the various commentors on that article do point out that a hash table would have avoided this whole scenario. I’m glad that I finally know how Path were doing that matching though - it’s been bugging me for weeks…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calling all beta testers</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/31/calling-all-beta-testers/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/31/calling-all-beta-testers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce that my biggest app yet is going to be available in mid-February. It’s currently running in a closed beta but I’m now looking to expand the beta testing pool significantly in the run up to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have some spare time and would like to help me out (as well as maybe getting some free stuff once it launches) then please fill out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/bendodson.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9vLXluM3RwNnZYNDRGendxWXBfTEE6MQ&quot;&gt;beta tester application form&lt;/a&gt;. Based on previous betas, I expect interest to be high so I’ve had to implement a cap on how many people I can accept. Please bear in mind that beta testing can take a lot of time (as you’ll be required to feedback on each build that is sent out) so if you don’t have the time please don’t apply as your position could go to somebody else who is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application is successful, I’ll be in touch by the 3rd of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to show you all what I’ve been working on for the past 6 months. More details will be available soon…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What's happening with iOS 5.1?</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/31/whats-happening-with-ios-5-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2012 09:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/31/whats-happening-with-ios-5-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;iOS 5.1 Beta 1 was released to developers back in November 2011. Since then there have only been 2 additional betas (the last of which was just over 3 weeks ago) but not one of them has added anything worthy of a 5.x update. There are only two additions of note for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2012/01/09/apple-seeds-ios-5-1-beta-3-to-developers/&quot;&gt;MacRumors reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;iOS 5.1 introduces a new API to mark files or directories that should not be backed up. For NSURL objects, add the NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey attribute to prevent the corresponding file from being backed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anandtech.com/show/5158/apple-seeds-ios-51-beta-to-developers&quot;&gt;AnandTech reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On supported devices, iOS automatically inserts recognized phrases into the current text view when the user has chosen dictation input. The new UIDictationPhrase class (declared in UITextInput.h) provides you with a string representing a phrase that a user has dictated. In the case of ambiguous dictation results, the new class provides an array containing alternative strings. New methods in the UITextInput protocol allow your app to respond to the completion of dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these things are worthy of a 5.x update as the first is just a reworking of a bug fix in 5.0.1 and the second doesn’t really have much of a practical use. If we look back at previous .x updates, Apple always puts something in that will appeal (and can be marketed) to the end user:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 4.1&lt;/strong&gt; - GameCenter, HDR Photo Capture, iTunes Ping (haha), HD Video Uploads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 4.2&lt;/strong&gt; - AirPrint, AirPlay, Fonts for Notes (it’s a big deal), Voice Memos App - was also the release that bought iOS 4 to the iPad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS 4.3&lt;/strong&gt; - Personal Hotspot, AirPlay in 3rd Party Apps, Home Sharing, 2x faster JavaScript in Safari, Mute Switch preference for iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all big updates and carry a number of new features which end users can relate to (i.e. they are not all dependent on developers integrating a new API). That’s what I don’t understand about iOS 5.1 so far – there are no end user features and the new bits that are there are very minor API updates that most developers won’t use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these rather minor updates, there is also the question of timing. iOS 5.1 has been with developers for over 2 months with a very slow release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s happening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory (and this is all speculation) is that iOS 5.1 does indeed add something big but we won’t see it until mid-February when the iPad 3 is announced. This is because the iPad 3 will come with iOS 5.1 pre-installed and so a number of the new features will be directly tied to that. As soon as the event is over, developers will be given a 5.1 GM along with around 3 weeks to submit apps to the App Store if they want to update to the new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current guess is that Siri will be prominent in iOS 5.1 as the introduction of the iPad 3 means there will be another device out there with Siri support (and that’s if they don’t open Siri up to the iPad 2 / iPhone 4). A 3rd party API for Siri will allow all kinds of amazing apps to appear (take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/12/06/hows-the-london-underground-ask-siri/&quot;&gt;Tube Updates plugin for SiriProxy&lt;/a&gt; for example) and will look great during the iPad 3 announcement keynote when Scott Forstall gets a number of prominent development studios to show off what they’ve done in 2 weeks of having access to the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Siri APIs do not a .x release make as that isn’t enough to make most people upgrade (such as the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 which I doubt are going to get Siri). A few other things I would hope to see in iOS 5.1 are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widgets&lt;/strong&gt; - the ability for developers to create Notification Center widgets such as the Weather and Stocks ones which come preinstalled. This is an area when Android is nominally “winning” and is something which should have been in iOS 5 in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Integration&lt;/strong&gt; - I’m not a big fan of Facebook but I can see it getting iOS level integration similar to Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Siri&lt;/strong&gt; - Aside from 3rd party dev support, allowing things like “read my mail” or “open this app”. I’d really like a “lower brightness” command.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iBooks&lt;/strong&gt; - Not really a big announcement but &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/30/retina-display-graphics-reappear-in-ibooks-2/&quot;&gt;I speculated yesterday that iBooks might become part of the core OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that I can’t really think of anything they can add to this release. I’d like to see a new maps app without Google (Apple have aquired enough mapping companies) and profiles on the iPad (so you can have multiple accounts) but I think these are more likely for iOS 6.0. Not related to iOS 5.1, but I’d also like to see iMessages bought over to the Mac App Store as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is for certain though – iOS 5.1 beta 3 is a long way off from what iOS 5.1 will actually be. It just isn’t a 5.x update at the moment but I’m certain all will be revealed at the iPad 3 keynote sometime in mid-February. If you’ve got any ideas for what you expect to see in iOS 5.1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;tweet at @bendodson&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll add the best ideas to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retina display graphics reappear in iBooks 2</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/30/retina-display-graphics-reappear-in-ibooks-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matthew Panzarino for TNW:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, with the release of the iBooks 2 application, the Retina-ready images are on display yet again, but our source says it is highly doubtful that including them this time is an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These images would display correctly on a screen 2048×1536 pixels in dimension (double the res of the iPad 2′s screen) at a PPI of 260. That is lower than the iPhone 4/4S display, which clocks in at just over 300 PPI, but should still qualify as a Retina display due to the viewing distance to the iPad being greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These @2x files appeared in a version of iBooks during August 2010 but turned out to be a red herring (or an accident as TNWs source puts it). However, with rumours ramping up for a March launch of the iPad 3, it’s highly likely that these retina display graphics are now needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that confuses me is that iBooks doesn’t come pre-installed on iOS so Apple could easily push out a v2.0.1 safe in the knowledge that a non-retina version wouldn’t end up on the new iPad. This is undoubtedly what will happen with the iWorks suite of apps (a minor update to add retina compatibility) so why add @2x versions of UI components to iBooks now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this was either a mistake (again) or Apple are planning on having iBooks installed by default on the iPad 3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Sneak Peek at Atomix Magazine v2.0</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/29/a-sneak-peek-at-atomix-magazine-v2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/29/a-sneak-peek-at-atomix-magazine-v2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve long been interested in magzines on the iPad and how they can be adapted to make best use of the medium. I was therefore very excited when &lt;a href=&quot;http://atomixmag.com/&quot;&gt;Atomix Magazine&lt;/a&gt; first launched in April last year as it was made exclusively for iPad and is focussed on videogames. At the time, most iPad magazines were using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-publishing.html&quot;&gt;Adobe publishing system&lt;/a&gt; which allows publishers to simply export their InDesign files to a custom iPad app. Whilst it works as a basic system for getting content to the iPad (which is better than no content), it is lacking when you consider that most magazines are at different physical sizes to the iPad. This means that unless publishers put the work in to rescale their content (and most don’t - I’m looking at you Future Publishing), then you end up needing to zoom in and pan around to read the content. Atomix was different in that the entire magazine was designed solely for the iPad and should have done away with these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content itself was absolutely fantastic but there were a number of issues I had with the app itself. In the first few issues they decided to go with a weird parralex background system which meant that the text scrolled differently to the background. You’d actually scroll – sometimes making the text unreadable – and then the background image would rubber band to where it should be. This was eventually sorted but then there were problem with fitting content onto a page (as shown in the image below). Whilst there were dividing lines which looked kind of like page breaks, the content would run to maybe 140% of the iPad height which meant you’d read one column, scroll to keep reading, then have to scroll back up to read the next column. These issues nearly made me give up on Atomix purely because reading it was so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/01/atomix-pagination.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bad page layout in Atomix Magazine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These layout problems were solved late last year (along with some problems relating to downloads) but by that point another bone of contention had cropped up; Newsstand. For those that don’t know, Newsstand was a system introduced with iOS 5 which basically made any magazine app able to show its latest issue as an app icon. This meant that you could see when a new issue was available and there were a number of useful additions such as the ability for new issues to download automatically in the background if you had a subscription. Atomix didn’t have Newsstand support when iOS 5 launched which I felt was unfortunate considering that iOS 5 had been in beta for nearly 3 months (plenty of time to integrate the new APIs for an app which is only available on iPad). Other readers obviously felt the same as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/atomixmag/&quot;&gt;@AtomixMag&lt;/a&gt; twitter account was always bombarded with people looking for an update on Newsstand support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this is now being implemented in version 2.0 of the app which will be available tomorrow. The Newsstand support extends not only to moving the app to the Newsstand folder, but also to implementing background downloads if you opt for a subscription. This is a great feature as issues can sometimes take a while to download (they’re around 300MB on average). Aside from Newsstand support, the app has been updated so that issues open a lot faster, has better graphics when you run or close an issue, and has a new download system meaning that any old issues you try to download will auto-resume if you close the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/01/atomix-newsstand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Atomix Magazine with Newsstand support&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the new version of the app and a new issue of the magazine coming tomorrow, Atomix also promised a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/atomixmag/status/162949681381519361&quot;&gt;big announcement&lt;/a&gt;” related to the publication. It turns out that this announcement relates to pricing in that Atomix Magazine will be free from now on! With Newsstand support, you are able to take out a free subscription that will work for future issues as well as allowing you to download previous issues free of charge. For this to work, you have to agree to pass on your personal information (a requisite for free subscriptions from Apple) but Atomix has said that they won’t actually store the information that is sent to them as they don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/weblog/2012/01/atomix-subscription.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Free subscription to Atomix Magazine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading the new issue of the magazine today and I have to say that the whole app does feel a lot snappier and easier to read. Proper paging has been implemented so that all of the content fits nicely into the space and the virtual layout works nicely. You scroll from left to right to go through the different stories but then these are paged vertically so you have to scroll down to read. Some articles have more content underneath so you scroll left to right to read it like a regular magazine but you are prevented from going to the next story unless you scroll to the top of the article. Overall I find it works very well and gives you a good overview of how pages are connected, something that is often a problem in tablet magazines. If I had one criticism, it’s that there is no indication of how far through the magazine you are and I’m hopeful this is something they will look to implement in future versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was loathe to recommend it a few months ago, this update now makes Atomix a shining example of how iPad magazines should be. It doesn’t try to add too much interactivity but instead focusses on great content laid out in the best way possible with a few interactive elements that delight rather than annoy. If you are an app developer, I would urge you to download Atomix and compare it with a magazine such as Edge, a magazine that could have got it right but instead opted for the lazy InDesign route. The differences should be clear. With Apple promoting Newsstand in a big way, I would expect more magazine publishers to follow Atomix example and go down the bespoke app route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of video games, then you should definitely &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/atomix-mag/id429125775?mt=8&quot;&gt;download this magazine&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2012/01/26/bendodsoncom-gets-an-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last time my website got a major upgrade was back on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/04/26/london-underground-tube-updates-api-is-live/&quot;&gt;26th April 2009&lt;/a&gt; when I moved from a self-built system to Wordpress (for my blog at least). Since then there have been a few minor design tweaks and a few page changes but the majority has stayed the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve put live a big update that covers the design, content, and functionality of the site. The main reasons for a change were two-fold; to help me update the site more frequently and to ensure a better reading experience for visitors, regardless of device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design changes are actually fairly minimal. I’ve put in a nicer font with more spacing and I’ve removed some unnecessary sidebars to make the site full width - it should be a lot more comfortable to read in a traditional browser. However, the biggest change is the introduction of a mobile stylesheet which still shows the full content of the site but rendered in a much nicer way. Needless to say, this has been optimised for iPhone but it should work on any mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing the content on my site has always been a bit of a chore from a UX view as it caters to very different audiences. You might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/contract-ios/&quot;&gt;hire me&lt;/a&gt;, look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/apps/&quot;&gt;my apps&lt;/a&gt;, play with some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/&quot;&gt;my projects&lt;/a&gt;, or simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;read my blog&lt;/a&gt;. You might have come here looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/browser-extensions/&quot;&gt;Firefox extension&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/09/airplay-mirroring-tv-out-and-the-apple-tv-as-a-games-console/&quot;&gt;read a post about the Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;, or because you want to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/work/apps/&quot;&gt;my portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I’ve done a slight reorganisation so that the main pieces of the site are all readily accessible. This was mainly done by separating &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/apps/&quot;&gt;my apps&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/&quot;&gt;my projects&lt;/a&gt; and restructuring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/work/&quot;&gt;work section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more and more people have come to my site, the number of emails I have to deal with has increased dramatically. I’m always keen to hear from people and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2010/11/04/contact-forms/&quot;&gt;I had my email addresses displayed loud and proud&lt;/a&gt; on my contact page. This hasn’t changed but I have introduced some new pages called “Guidelines” which might help you if your enquiry fits into a particular area. For example, if you’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/contract-ios/&quot;&gt;contacting me about a contract position&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to see my day rate and the projects I enjoy so that you can be sure I’m the right person for the job. Whilst I expect to receive significantly less enquiries, I’m hopeful that those I do receive (particularly for work) are more fruitful for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; has been updated so that I can now link to external sites that I find interesting and just add a comment to them (similar to the linked lists on &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;). Quite often I see an interesting topic that I’d like to comment on that is too big for Twitter but too small for a full blown blog post. Now that I can link to external stories more easily I should be able to keep the weblog posts more regular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about comments, I don’t allow them on my website and I haven’t done for over a year now. Keeping on top of moderation, etc, was providing too much of a hassle and I prefer the one-to-one contact of email or the public sharing of Twitter which ensures that I can actually reply (most people didn’t sign up for email alerts on comments). However, I do frequently update my posts to include any interesting comments people send to me so please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you have something to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functionality&quot;&gt;Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the biggest update has come. I’ve long been getting bored with Wordpress and have always found it a bit of a chore to put posts out. Also, the site was quite slow but the various caching plugins I found weren’t quite doing it for me. To that end, the entire site has been replaced with completely static HTML (aside from some of the project pages). I write all my blog posts in Markdown and these are now pushed through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to be converted to pure HTML. However the coolest bit (for me) is that I’m running a Dropbox instance on my server - this means that whenever I compile the site with Jekyll on one of my macs, all of the generated files are automatically synced to my server and then through a symlink to my web directory. In short, I can post entries more quickly and they will load much faster for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you find any problems please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One More Thing&lt;/strong&gt; - I almost forgot! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;All of my code samples and snippets are now available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lewis Peckover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on O2’s UK mobile network (not ADSL), you’ll (probably) see a line beginning with &lt;code&gt;x-up-calling-line-id&lt;/code&gt; - followed by your mobile phone number in plain text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like O2 is sending users mobile phone numbers in plain text over HTTP headers to every site they visit whilst using their network. At the moment the issue appears to be limited to certain APNS on the UK O2 network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/o2/status/161872584634408960&quot;&gt;O2 responded with&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mobile number in the HTML is linked to how the site determines that your browsing from a mobile device&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lewis points out, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lewispeckover/status/161879864159383552&quot;&gt;User-agent header ID’s the device&lt;/a&gt;” so this seems a slightly odd stance (particularly as it isn’t happening on all mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; O2 say that it’s a technical error and that this header should only be sent to whitelisted servers. It does beg the question, which servers are whitelisted? Presumably just O2’s own websites but it’s still not good to be sending information like this in plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How not to ask for an iOS app review - A review of Jumpship Thrust Control 2</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/12/12/how-not-to-ask-for-an-ios-app-review-a-review-of-jumpship-thrust-control-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/12/12/how-not-to-ask-for-an-ios-app-review-a-review-of-jumpship-thrust-control-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The CEO of Monkeybin emailed me with a few corrections to this piece. Be sure to read the updates at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get contacted by quite a few developers of iOS apps asking for me to write a review up on my blog. Occasionally I agree and I&#39;m always completely honest and independent in my thoughts. If I don&#39;t like the app, I say so and this is either met with annoyance (&quot;we only wanted you to publish a good review&quot;) or with good grace (&quot;thanks for your honest review - we&#39;ve taken your criticisms on board and aim to fix them for the next release&quot;). Today, I received an email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://monkeybin.no/&quot;&gt;Monkeybin Studios&lt;/a&gt; asking me to review their game &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jumpship-thrust-control/id422849746?mt=8&quot;&gt;Jumpship Thrust Control&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bit of an odd one (as you&#39;ll see in a moment) so I think I&#39;ll review the app by listing the email that was sent below and then dissecting each section. This will hopefully serve as a) a review of the app and b) as a lesson on how not to ask for iOS app reviews (not just from me, but from any blog or review site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hi Fellow Gamer!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Please find attached details of Jumpship Thrust Control 2 - a new game on the scene for iPhone and iPad users - we’d love it if you can review it on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds interesting - maybe I&#39;ll review it. Shame they didn&#39;t include a download link to the game though as it&#39;s actually version 2.0 of an app called &quot;JumpShip Thrust Control&quot;. The first time I searched for it (copying and pasting the name), iTunes couldn&#39;t find it. Also, there is no detail here (or later in the email) of pricing information. I&#39;ve no idea if this is a paid app (in which case, where is free promotional code so I can download it) or a free app. Turns out this is a free app and you can use In-App Purchases to unlock later levels. If you are asking for a review of your app, be sure to include pricing information (as it&#39;s a key review metric) as well as any promotional codes so that a reviewer can use the full app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Give it a try – we promise the top-notch graphics and the old school side-scroller “action” nature of the game will have you hooked. It’s a throwback to the days of Atari and Commodore 64 video gaming but with 2012 style graphics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 style graphics you say? An interesting pitch when games like Infinity Blade II came out in 2011. By way of demonstration, here is a screenshot of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0095.png&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0095.PNG&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0095.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that pretty much speaks for itself. An oil type background (looks alright) with some clipart stuck on top. The only bit that I could claim is even modern is that the flames at the back move a little bit but I believe this is a fairly simple effect to do with Cocos2D so we shouldn&#39;t put too much stock in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When I say “new game” Jumpship Thrust Control is actually a completely re-vamped and much improved version of an existing game from the team at Monkeybin Studios; you have to steer a spaceship through many different types of beautiful but hazardous terrain, navigating many evil obstacles in the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read this sentence, I thought &quot;ah good, at least they admit it&#39;s a rip-off game&quot; but then they go on to say that it&#39;s a remake of one of their old games! I think you&#39;ll find that this exact game mechanic has been popularised oh so many times before. Here&#39;s a small history of these games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Cobra&quot;&gt;Super Cobra&lt;/a&gt; (Atari game from 1983 - the original game of this type I believe)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helicoptergame.net/&quot;&gt;Helicopter Game&lt;/a&gt; (Flash game made in 2004 - the most well known on the internet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/helicopter/id322998366?mt=8&quot;&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; (iPhone version of the above two games - blatant copying in 2009)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s just a very quick run through how this game has appeared over the years but there are hundreds of copies with different types of vehicle ranging from tractors to spaceships. This is just another one of those that doesn&#39;t even try to avoid the obvious link in that the first level is &quot;cave&quot; where every helicopter version of this genre starts. Why is a spaceship in a cave (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Exogorth&quot;&gt;are they sure it&#39;s a cave&lt;/a&gt;?). They could have at least tried a funny parody to make this game different in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/baby-monkey-going-backwards/id447960108?mt=8&quot;&gt;Baby Monkey (Going Backwards On A Pig)&lt;/a&gt; did with the platforming genre, but no, it&#39;s just a shameless copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Gamers said the previous version was too difficult and there was nothing to cater for the serious gamers over the casual gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s clarify something here; there are casual gamers and there are serious gamers. Serious gamers play on the PS3 and Xbox, casual games play on the Wii and on mobile phones (with the possible exception of Infinity Blade II which is console quality on the iPhone). This is a casual game by the fact that it&#39;s horribly repetitive and is the sort of thing you play on the tube when you&#39;ve finished reading the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The many improvements in the new version include 3 different player modes (beginner, intermediate and expert) plus 5 new terrains to master and easier controls for the spaceship; there’s also a training mode built in to get you up to speed with controlling the spaceship before you try the beginners’ level for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New terrains and level difficulty does not a &quot;serious gamer&quot; game make. If they&#39;d wanted to make it more competitive they should have put in some sort of peer-to-peer mechanic where two people start at the same time on different devices and the first one to die loses. If they&#39;d wanted to make it more engaging over a long time period (rather than a pick up and play kind of game) then they should have put in a levelling system with spaceship upgrades (which you could charge real money for with In-App Purchasing). Adding a difficulty level isn&#39;t going to make all the Battlefield 3 and Skyrim players drop their controllers and pick up this app instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Just to make your life easier, we attach a couple of reviews we have already written that highlight some of the key features of the game. Perhaps you can cut and paste some of the comments and claim them as your own review?! (Just thinking of your time. :))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the part of the email where I made up my mind to do a review of the app. You can download and read their prewritten reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/jumpship-review-1.doc&quot;&gt;review #1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/jumpship-review-2.doc&quot;&gt;review #2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s difficult to know where to start but this is sort of behaviour is what I hate about the app industry in many ways. There are thousands of apps out there but they are hard to find unless you get coverage in the right places. That does not mean you email blogs with pre-written reviews asking them to &quot;claim them as your own&quot;. Just don&#39;t do it. If you want to have your app reviewed, you have to accept that people may not like it sometimes. Take their criticism, and improve your app. It&#39;s insulting to be given pre-written content as you&#39;re basically saying to the reviewer &quot;we don&#39;t trust your judgement or other write-ups - just use our content&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not to say you shouldn&#39;t provide text to a reviewer, but it should be done as a press release. That way, they can pick and choose any interesting elements (e.g. &quot;this is the first game to use x feature&quot;) and write it into their review without physically copying / pasting. You can also include reviews from other real people that show off good features of your app, particularly if you&#39;ve had good press coverage from other outlets. But don&#39;t ever write your own reviews and ask people to use them. That is incredibly underhand and doesn&#39;t do either the journalism or app development industries any favours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for taking a look at our game and Happy Jumpshipping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a few thoughts on the app which I haven&#39;t covered above so I&#39;ll quickly list them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levels&lt;/strong&gt; - there is only 1 level included with the game followed by 4 trial levels that you get a little distance with before being asked to make an In-App Purchase. There is also a boss level which can be purchased. Both In-App Purchases cost 69p which is fair enough but this isn&#39;t detailed anywhere in the app description. The description says &quot;5 great new landscape levels&quot;, the &quot;what&#39;s new&quot; text says &quot;5 NEW LEVELS&quot;, and the email I got said &quot;5 new terrains to master&quot;. At no point does it say you&#39;ll need to purchase these until you&#39;re in the game. It&#39;s a free game, so it&#39;s understandable you&#39;ll have to pay at some point, but it&#39;s deceptive to list &quot;5 levels&quot; everywhere when you are actually only getting one with your download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; - it&#39;s buggy as hell. On my second go on the first level, my ship would no longer blow up. Here&#39;s a photo of something that just shouldn&#39;t happen on a game thats main bit of code is &quot;if ship hits wall, ship explodes&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0103.png&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0103.PNG&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0103.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as that issue, the UI would freeze if I closed the app and came back to it whilst it was on the pause menu. Music would still play but I couldn&#39;t touch anything so had to force quit the app. That would be annoying if you were on a high-score streak and got a text message or a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt; - training mode is apparently designed to be a place where you can&#39;t crash in order to get you used to the game. They don&#39;t tell you this anywhere in the app though so you&#39;d be forgiven for wondering what is going on as the game never ends, you can&#39;t crash, and no power-ups or walls appear anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power-ups&lt;/strong&gt; - there are power ups littered through the game (with icons that look like they were plucked from windows 95) but no description of what they do. You have to learn by trial and error that a blue orb means you can delete a bit of level or that something that looks like a move cursor is actually a power up to shrink you temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the game is just plain awful. When you take into account the deception around In-App Purchases and that they are trying to get reviewers to post pre-written reviews, it becomes a despicable game. Very little thought has gone into gameplay or design and the only reason I even downloaded it was as an example of how to demonstrate what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of how you should market your apps, I can strongly recommend putting together a good media pack such as the one outlined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrodreamer.com/blog/2011/08/how-to-media-kits-retro-dreamer-style/&quot;&gt;Retro Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; (linked to from &lt;a href=&quot;http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/4/&quot;&gt;iOS Dev Weekly Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, a must subscription for iOS developers). I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightsapp.com/files/media-kit.zip&quot;&gt;media kit&lt;/a&gt; for my apps such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/a&gt; which has some screenshots, information, and release notes that allow any reviewers to have a complete overview of the app. If you follow that guide, you&#39;ll find you get a lot more responses from app reviewers than if you follow the example taken by Monkeybin Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (12th December 2011):&lt;/strong&gt; I replied to the email to let them know I&#39;d put this review up and got the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hi Ben,&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your review. We respect your opinion and we have taken notes of our mistakes and your sugesstions. Hopefully we&#39;ll do better in future. We respect your judgment, pre-written reviews were just because of the fact that many webmasters may receive hundreds of emails daily and they may not find a time to write for every one.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have respect for a company that actually replies to negative criticism so that&#39;s good at least. I still think the app can be vastly improved and hopefully we&#39;ll see that happen in this case at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (15th December 2011):&lt;/strong&gt; Today I received an email from the CEO of Monkeybin to let me know that the person who contacted me regarding writing a review was not in fact an employee of Monkeybin but instead a freelancer who had operated outside of their remit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hi Ben,&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;My name is Haakon Langaas Lageng, and I am the CEO at Monkeybin. You have been in touch with &lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;, and I would like to point out that &lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt; is not a Monkeybin employee.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We hired them as a freelancing marketing manager to do the promotions for JumpShip Thrust Control, and it got out of hand. They were free to do the promotions the way they thought would be best, since we were pressed on time doing other projects. It resulted in methods that is not up to Monkeybin&#39;s ethics or standards, and not how we want to be perceived by the gaming community.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As the CEO of Monkeybin, this is of course completely my responsibility. Unfortunately, what was happening here slipped my eyes. I found out only yesterday what has been going on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I just saw on your site that &lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt; sent you an &quot;explanation&quot; on the 12th December, and I am sorry they got around doing that before I put the brakes on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you are going to publish what I just wrote here, please omit &lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt; name. They made some bad judgements, yes, but in the end, as I said, it is all my responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of guts for a CEO to claim ultimate responsibility for an error by a contractor rather than trying to use it as an excuse and I applaud Haakon for it. Let this be a lesson to everybody that you should fully research anybody you ask to promote apps for you and ensure you stay on top of what is being done in your companies name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo&quot;&gt;SiriProxy in action on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, I was keen to grab an iPhone 4S to have a play with it. I managed to pick one up at the Apple Store yesterday and today I&#39;m pleased to release my first SiriProxy plugin; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/SiriProxy-TubeUpdates&quot;&gt;TubeUpdates&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a basic plugin that lets you ask Siri for the status of a London Underground line thanks to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;TubeUpdates API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0066.png&quot; alt=&quot;SiriProxy-TubeUpdates - A standard request&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0066.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve not dabbled with Ruby for a while but building the plugin was fairly straightforward. All of the code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/SiriProxy-TubeUpdates/&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but the main piece looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listen_for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/[what is,what&amp;#39;s] the status of (.*)/i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encodedline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gsub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;+&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http://tubeupdates.com/siri/?line=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encodedline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;status&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;messages&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;There are additional details. Would you like to hear them?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/yes/i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#process their response            &lt;/span&gt;
	        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;messages&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
	            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
	        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request_completed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matching in the first line ensures that you can ask either &quot;what is (or what&#39;s) the status of (the line name)&quot;. This is then url encoded and &quot;the line name&quot; is sent to a Siri endpoint I created on the Tube Updates site. The site will return a JSON string of the tube line status which is then parsed and spoken back to the user. E.g. &quot;The Circle line is running a good service&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any messages for the line (these are generally details of delays), then an additional step is performed; the user is asked if they would like to hear the details and answering &quot;yes&quot; will list them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0065.png&quot; alt=&quot;SiriProxy-TubeUpdates - A delayed line&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0065.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s pretty much it! I&#39;ve got a few ideas for more complex plugins that can interface directly with iPhone apps so I&#39;ll have a play with those when I get a spare moment. If you&#39;ve got any comments or feature requests for this plugin, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, this is the first project I&#39;ve published that is written in Ruby and the first time I&#39;ve put anything up on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye Gowalla</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/12/03/goodbye-gowalla/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/12/03/goodbye-gowalla/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d originally been planning to post up a review of Gowalla v4 (late I know, but it was fairly in-depth look at a company gone mad) but last nights news that Gowalla is to be acquired by Facebook means that I&#39;ve bought forward another post I&#39;d been planning; my goodbye to Gowalla. After being a loyal user for just over 2 years, the time has finally come for me to delete the app that has been a key part of my life for a rather long time.   
&lt;h3&gt;Beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;
Gowalla was built by a company called Alamofire (before they changed their name to just Gowalla) and I became acquainted to it via one of their other projects; &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.facebook.com/packrat/&quot;&gt;PackRat&lt;/a&gt;. It was a game that involved collecting sets of cards with different icons on was pretty addictive. When they decided to make a mobile game, I assumed it would be similar to PackRat but with a location element. Instead, Gowalla was created allowing you to check-in at places as well as collect virtual items. The collection part wasn&#39;t terribly well thought out and went through several iterations but it garnered quite a cult following. In addition to items, you could collect &quot;stamps&quot; by checking in at locations and &quot;pins&quot; by completing tasks (e.g. check in at 10 different coffee shops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/100-stamps.png&quot; alt=&quot;My first 100 stamps!&quot; title=&quot;100-stamps.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time, everything was rosy. New items would come out on a Tuesday (leading to mass checkins at the categories the item was likely to appear at) and people were steadily competing to see how many stamps they could get. I think the highest I ever saw was somebody who had checked in at over 9500 places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2009, I quit playing PackRat as they introduced a number of changes which made the game less enjoyable (e.g. locking key cards unless you got friends to join the game, adding &quot;bling&quot;). This was probably a premonition of things to come as Gowalla would eventually make the same mistake - disenfranchising their core audience rather than embracing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Developing for Gowalla&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2009 I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/07/gowalla-tools-web-app-find-your-missing-gowalla-items/&quot;&gt;created a basic web app for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that would allow you to find items by showing you the categories that were most likely to drop a specific item. It proved to be incredibly popular, so over Christmas 2009 I introduced 13 new tools or web apps in a project I called &quot;Gowalla Tools&quot; which ranged from being able to view Flickr photos at Gowalla spots to temporarily turning Gowalla.com into a PackRat game (thanks to some JavaScript) which would allow people to collect coins which were then used to give out prizes. This again was so popular that I started to devote more time to making apps that ran on top of Gowalla. There wasn&#39;t an official API when I started but by early 2010, Gowalla launched the first version of their API. This is where things started to deteriorate…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Fallout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new API started out with good intentions, but constant breakages and undocumented changes made it a frustration to use, let alone build apps with. At the time, I&#39;d been working on a native iPhone app but there was no way it could go out with the Gowalla API as it was. Had Gowalla altered anything, then the app would have remained broken until I could fix it and then sit through the 2 week Apple App Review process - not ideal. So it was that I rallied together a few other developers and a number of Gowalla players and wrote a letter entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gowallatools.com/api/&quot;&gt;Thoughts On The Gowalla API&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Gowalla never replied or apologised (and one of the team called me a &quot;jackass&quot; when I met them at SXSW a year later) but the API did eventually improve months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Reconcilliation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2010, after the API had been updated and a number of (highly priced) apps had been built on top of it, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/14045036&quot;&gt;relaunch Gowalla Tools&lt;/a&gt;. Initially it was going to be called &quot;Gowalla Plus&quot; but that idea didn&#39;t sit well with Gowalla:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hey Ben,&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Adam sent along your email to me regarding naming conventions. Hopefully I can address both of our concerns in this email.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;These are always sticky situations because we want to support the app developers building great apps on the API, but we also need to avoid confusion from both a legal and customer support standpoint. You&#39;ve likely observed that our naming conventions follow this standard approach:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Gowalla for iPhone, Gowalla for iPad, Gowalla for Android, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m afraid GowallaPlus is simply too close to our mark and if we let it fly, we have to let everything fly from a trademark standpoint. To be honest, I&#39;ve always been a concerned about GowallaTools, but have wanted to avoid hassling you.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We deal with complaints and support email every week from folks who believe certain apps sold in the iTunes store starting with Gowalla in their names are actually our product. We&#39;ll be working with each of these developers to change their names.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not against a mention of Gowalla in the name. I just can&#39;t have the name on the front side.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;[ProductName] for Gowalla would be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of folks believing GowallaPlus is our app is super high, based on our experience with the other apps in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting us know your thoughts in advance. I&#39;m in hopes we can encourage you to develop your own brand name for your line up of products. I think you&#39;ve got a good thing going.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Related: I&#39;d love to get a beta of the &quot;travel edition&quot; if you&#39;re open to it. I&#39;m traveling to South America later this month and would love to give it run. Seems perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts and questions. I know we haven&#39;t always been your favorite guys to be developing with, but I hope we can find some solutions here that work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thanks Ben!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;jw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no other app was ever actually removed for having the word &quot;Gowalla&quot; in it. In any case, I decided to rebrand my projects as &quot;Wallabee&quot; and started off by releasing my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/wallabee/#travel&quot;&gt;&quot;Wallabee: Travel Edition&quot; app&lt;/a&gt;; an app that let you check-in multiple people on Gowalla with more than 99% savings on data usage (which translates into big savings if you&#39;re using data roaming). Unfortunately, despite being a free app (and the encouragement from Josh above), Gowalla never publicised it in anyway e.g. on their Twitter feed or blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over Christmas 2010, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/xmas2010/&quot;&gt;unleashed some plans for further apps and developments&lt;/a&gt; including an Item Hunter, Time Travel Edition (showing historical changes to places), and version 2 of the Travel Edition app. Unfortunately the release of version 2.0 was &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/2010/12/14/travel-edition-2-0-delay-due-to-functionality-changes/&quot;&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; due to Gowalla having an issue with the mass check-in facility I&#39;d added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in March 2011, myself and a number of good friends I&#39;ve made through Gowalla launched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/&quot;&gt;Wallabee Pouch&lt;/a&gt;, a definitive guide to all aspects of Gowalla. It also featured the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/directory/&quot;&gt;Item Directory&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, the largest repository of information about Gowalla items including real-time item drop rates and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SXSW / Re-evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2010, I decided to head over to Austin for SXSW in March 2011 as I was keen to meet up with the Gowalla team and a few other Gowalla players were all heading over for a week of item hunting, stamp collecting, and general socialising. I&#39;d also opened up a conversation with Gowalla around their vacancy for an iPhone developer so I was keen to have a discussion about it whilst I was there. Unfortunately, things turned out slightly different to how I imagined. I saw firsthand some of the pettiness and childlike behaviour that certain players exhibited around items and suddenly realised why Gowalla tried not to have much to do with their original players if they all acted like that. Despite organising a meet up around the iPhone developer role, it fell through with the HR contact failing to arrange anything (apparently a systemic problem within the company - departments often have no interaction with each other and there is &quot;rampant disorganisation&quot; - that was a quote from an employee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part for me of SXSW was listening to Josh&#39;s talk on the future of location-based services, a talk that I still maintain is one of the most interesting I&#39;ve ever attended. It was at that point that I realised the writing was on the wall for the item-based gamification of Gowalla and that they would eventually change into just being a service based on check-ins. I decided to stop focussing on items and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/&quot;&gt;stood down from Wallabee&lt;/a&gt; to focus on making travel based tools instead. My premonition turned out to be correct when &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gowalla.com/post/9378150015/going-forward&quot;&gt;Gowalla announced that items wouldn&#39;t be making it&lt;/a&gt; to the next version of the app in August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&#39;d stopped working on Wallabee, I started focussing intently on my next big project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightsapp.com/&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/a&gt;. It was an app that would help you find the best places around you by using recommendations from other users. The twist was that it used location data from both Foursquare and Gowalla and used a complex algorithm to rank them based on comments, tips, highlights, photos, etc. It also pulled in vast amounts of data from other services like Last.fm, Yelp, and Flickr. To power the system, I tapped into the Pubsubhubbub hub for Gowalla courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://superfeedr.com/&quot;&gt;Superfeedr&lt;/a&gt; - this allowed me to get every checkin that happened on Gowalla in real-time and build up my own vast database of checkin data and locations thus bypassing the need to directly connect to Gowalla&#39;s API (due to the issues I&#39;d had previously). You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/07/25/the-inside-story-on-powering-highlights/&quot;&gt;read more about the integration in a post I did about it&lt;/a&gt; if that sort of thing interests you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 2nd (which also happened to be my birthday), Apple made Highlights their &quot;iPad App of the Week&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/IMG_0001.png&quot; alt=&quot;Highlights - iPad App of the Week&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0001.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent some promotional codes direct to Josh (and a few other Gowalla staff members) in the hope that they might at least tweet about the app or put up a blog post about it as they had for other apps (although I found out later that the one app they publicised was part-built by one of their developers). As a one-man development studio, a single tweet from Gowalla would have made a big difference in the number of downloads but unfortunately it didn&#39;t happen. Despite being featured by Apple, given high ratings on app review sites, and being reviewed in numerous magazines and popular sites (such as TUAW), Gowalla didn&#39;t want to acknowledge it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was running a company with an API and one of the apps got a lot of good press, I&#39;d be the first person to try and publicise it as it can only benefit both parties. It still surprises me that Gowalla never understood 3rd party developers and I often wonder why they even bothered making a public API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gowalla v4.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During September 2011, Gowalla released version 4.0 of their app to great fanfare at TechCrunch Disrupt. On the surface, it looked like a solid update. A beautiful design and a core rethinking of the product meant that they were stepping in the direction I thought they would after the talk at SXSW. However, once I got to use the app, I couldn&#39;t believe how badly wrong they had got it. I&#39;m not going to go into a huge amount of detail on it (as I believe the app will disappear soon anyway) but here are my main points about what is wrong with Gowalla v4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stories&lt;/strong&gt; - The fundamental idea that a check-in is a story is genius. Whilst going to the grocery store isn&#39;t really worthy of a &quot;story&quot;, there are many times when story is exactly the word to use. When I heard about it, I thought that Gowalla would extend the great work they&#39;d done on starting and ending points of journeys. They had previously put out an update which would show a little aeroplane graphic showing when people had travelled from one location to another and had gone further to detect when a journey had begun and ended. For instance, I got a &quot;Survived SXSW&quot; badge only once I got back to Gatwick Airport in the UK as that&#39;s when my SXSW journey had begun from. I imagined they&#39;d use this so that if I went on holiday, it would detect that and bundle up all my checkins and photos as a single story. What actually happened is that a story is a single place only thing and is more about the people that are there rather than the places. It works great if you have lots of friends in a single place but it kind of sucks if you&#39;re doing a pub crawl or going to more than one place. The fact that people can also check you in despite not being there (some people kept saying &quot;Ben&#39;s here&quot; at spots in the US which kind of annoyed me) instantly made this a painful update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; - In Gowalla v3, you could leave notes for people at a spot. They could only read these notes when they checked in at that place. This was a great usage of the location-based nature of the app but was removed. Apparently it was going to be put back in at some point but it&#39;s never materialised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guides&lt;/strong&gt; - The main button on the Gowalla app is a section called &quot;Guides&quot;. It&#39;s beautifully designed (looks a bit like the &quot;popular&quot; section of Highlights) but is completely inappropriate to be the main feature of the app. It basically shows you the best places to go in a city based on check-ins and what Gowalla have featured (as well as other companies like Disney and National Geographic). The problems are twofold; 1) it&#39;s poorly implemented (the top spot to visit in Disney&#39;s Animal Kingdom was Spaceship Earth, the iconic ride from Epcot - not quite right) and 2) it&#39;s limited to 60 places. This means that in the UK, the only guide is for London. The next nearest is Amsterdam. How this is of any use to people day-to-day is beyond me. The key feature should have been stories until such a point that guides were auto-generated (like Highlights is) at which point it could have been more prominent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just 3 of the main criticisms I have but overall the whole product is just lousy. Whilst it&#39;s beautiful to look at, very little thought has gone into how the user will engage the product as highlighted by the way Guides is the largest button in the interface. I also got really frustrated with the way that bits of the UI would load in later (so the photos might appear and then a few seconds later text would appear). This is obviously to keep loading times down but there is no indicator of it happening so the UI is constantly moving leading to a jarring experience. From a technical point of view, it has obviously not undergone any external testing as it crashes a huge amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the product felt like it had been rushed to get it out for TechCrunch Disrupt. Rather than pausing and releasing a top-rate product, they pushed out a half-built poorly thought out mess and they have suffered for it. Whilst there are many reviews hammering them for removing items (and not delivering on their promise of letting people export them in a &quot;really cool way&quot;), there are hundreds of 1 star reviews on iTunes from people hating the new update for the reasons above. I think the biggest problem is that they removed functionality without replacing it within anything better. Also, the changes weren&#39;t communicated to regular users. My mum, for example, loved using Gowalla v3 but when v4 came up she had no idea what had happened. She, like many users, doesn&#39;t read the Gowalla blog or see the updates on TechCrunch so had no idea that items were going or that they were going to fundamentally change direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it have been done better? I had always thought that Gowalla would spin off into two kick-ass products; a game (based on items) and a check-in service (with stories as I described them). Instead, it cut off the bit it didn&#39;t like and released an updated check-in service that did less than it promised. It doesn&#39;t aid in the discovery of places and it doesn&#39;t aid in the telling of stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a torrent of negative feedback, suspicions grew that Gowalla would be shut down during November 2011. Many of their employees had started using Foursquare and it looked like several prominent members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/etherbrian/status/137330108997443586&quot;&gt;staff had been sacked&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, Gowalla v4.0.3 had mysteriously disappeared from the App Store without warning. When rumours emerged that Gowalla was &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/30/technology/startup_acquisitions/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; (and had been brushed off by Google and Groupon) I thought that they would definitely be disappearing. Who would want to buy a company that had made such a monumental cockup and was haemorrhaging users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a tactic referred to as &quot;aqhiring&quot;, it would appear that Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/02/technology/gowalla_facebook/index.htm&quot;&gt;buying Gowalla out&lt;/a&gt; and taking some of the employees to Facebook HQ to work on a new timeline feature. This most likely means that Gowalla will close down (and I&#39;d imagine PackRat with it) as all the staff are reassigned to Facebook projects - I think it highly unlikely that Gowalla will survive as a Facebook product or keep going alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are now worried about data from Gowalla being moved over to Facebook. We&#39;ll have to wait and see if this actually happens but in the mean time a large number of people are deleting their Gowalla accounts to keep their privacy safe. I&#39;m now officially done with Gowalla and today I did the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-03-at-12.54.54.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2011 12 03 at 12 54 54&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-12-03 at 12.54.54.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In closing...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gowalla has been a big part of my life for the past couple of years. I&#39;ve made some great friends and I&#39;ve had some truly great experiences. Discovering new places when looking for items was a highlight and I&#39;m proud of the apps and features I was able to build on top of Gowalla. However, there have also been some truly horrible times both with Gowalla itself and some of the people that have played it. Whilst I wish them all the best, I honestly don&#39;t think Gowalla is going to survive in it&#39;s current form and I don&#39;t think that it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish off, I&#39;d like to thank everybody who made Gowalla a great experience for me from the people I&#39;ve met playing to those that supported the apps I built. I&#39;d also like to personally thank 3 people at Gowalla who helped me out when they could and to whom I&#39;m very grateful; Jon Carroll, Adam McManus, and Andrew Dupont. I hope they get what they want from the transition that is about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also like to thank whoever at Gowalla designed this icon for my &quot;Ben Dodson Apps&quot; spot...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/12/422-0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08-200.png&quot; alt=&quot;422 0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08 200&quot; title=&quot;422-0a295dbebaf7fff8a7590632a228bc08-200.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;border: 0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was never sent to me (I found it on their server - don&#39;t ask) and they never used it on my spot page (saying they don&#39;t do portraits for spot icons) but I&#39;ve always really liked it over the one that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/spots/7127793&quot;&gt;eventually used&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The API behind Gowalla v4</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/10/24/the-api-behind-gowalla-v4/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Gowalla released version 4.0 of their app to an overwhelmingly negative response. I myself will be posting a review soon but in this quick post I wanted to share a few tips on how to use the new API that is powering the app as an official API is apparently not coming until Q1 2012.   
In a post entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/880cc4a5de51e016&quot;&gt;Where the Gowalla API is going&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on the official Gowalla Developers Group, it was revealed that most bits of the existing API &quot;should be working&quot; but a version 2 of the API would be coming in 2012 that enables developers to leverage the new features such as stories, lists, likes, guides, and so on. Unfortunately, several parts of the existing API broke on launch of the new app (including OAuth integration which took out nearly all 3rd party apps, trips, and an advanced search API) and some parts were completely removed (such as PubSubhubbub, one of the key things that actually made the Gowalla API a compelling thing to use). I have a number of apps that use the old API and were affected in small ways (I learnt long ago never to make direct calls to the Gowalla API) but there were a few things like trips that I needed direct access to more immediately. So, I spent a few minutes digging into the new Gowalla app and found the new connection details that are required to talk to the new API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s actually fairly easy! Firstly, instead of connecting to http://api.gowalla.com/ change the URL to &lt;strong&gt;https://api9000.gowalla.com/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, there are 4 headers you have to send with every request. 2 of them, &quot;&lt;code&gt;Accept: application/json&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;X-Gowalla-API-Key&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, were required for the old API but Gowalla have also added an &quot;&lt;code&gt;X-Gowalla-Bruce-Lee&lt;/code&gt;&quot; header (with a password so they know it&#39;s the Gowalla app using the API) and an &quot;&lt;code&gt;X-Gowalla-API-Version&lt;/code&gt;&quot; header which seems to suggest they are taking my advice of 18 months ago and versioning the API rather than just breaking existing apps. So, the full headers you need to send are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Accept: application/json
X-Gowalla-API-Key: YOUR-API-KEY-HERE
X-Gowalla-Bruce-Lee: l33tkuned0
X-Gowalla-API-Version: 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do that, you should be able to call an API endpoint such as users/bendodson where you&#39;ll find a load of new data that isn&#39;t in the normal API. That should also give you a good idea of the naming conventions of new endpoints (e.g. /lists rather than /trips). In all of my testing, existing features such as OAuth have worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final example, the trips detail API is still broken on the current API (despite this being &quot;looked into&quot; 2 weeks ago). If you were to request &lt;code&gt;trips/168&lt;/code&gt; you&#39;ll get a 404 not found error. This is one of the many broken API calls that is affecting apps that are currently out in the wild. However, if you change your code to use the new URL and the new headers, you can request &lt;code&gt;lists/168&lt;/code&gt; to get full details of the trip you are after. Some of the keys will have changed name but it should be enough to get your app at least up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you use all of the above at your own risk. Gowalla are unlikely to break anything immediately as any changes to the headers, endpoints, or keys will break their app. However, there will probably be changes as and when they release new versions of their apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been very vocal on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/12/one-year-on-further-thoughts-on-the-gowalla-api/&quot;&gt;the good&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/12/gowalla-api-problems/&quot;&gt;the bad&lt;/a&gt; points of the Gowalla API in the past. There had been a real effort to alert 3rd party developers to changes in recent months but the new v4 app fundamentally broke important parts of the API (particularly OAuth login) and fixes were slow coming or have still yet to come with regards to the /trips endpoint. Putting an API out for the new app in Q1 of next year is a very long time to wait for something that really should have launched alongside or shortly after the new app particularly as the API does already exist. In short, Gowalla really have a long way to improve in their dealings with 3rd party developers. Personally, I&#39;m moving my apps away from Gowalla and starting to use other services but I&#39;ll be posting more about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update [25th Oct 2011]:&lt;/strong&gt; Andrew Dupont responded to this article on the Gowalla Devs Group with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any rate, we&#39;ve fixed the trips API. Let me know if anything&#39;s still out of order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out Gowalla will fix things if you complain enough...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highlights v1.1 - Gowalla Trips, Last.fm Events, and Translations</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/08/20/highlights-v1-1-gowalla-trips-last-fm-events-and-translations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve been following my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;ll know about my iOS app &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that lets you find interesting places around the world based on data from Gowalla and Foursquare. The app is doing phenomenally well in the UK becoming the #1 paid iPad travel app and reaching the top 20 of all paid iPad apps! I&#39;m happy to announce that version 1.1 is now available as a free upgrade on the App Store and has a number of great new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last.fm Events&lt;/strong&gt; - When looking at a theatre, park, or music venue, Highlights will show you the upcoming events and let you tap through to Last.fm to find out more and list yourself as attending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gowalla Trips&lt;/strong&gt; - Each location can now show you every trip it has been added to on Gowalla. This isn&#39;t just the featured trips, but every single trip ever created. When you&#39;re looking at a trip, you can choose to add it to your planner with one tap making it really easy to plan a day out in a new town. Additionally, you can find trips near you via the planner and also search for trips around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View plans on a map&lt;/strong&gt; - In the previous version, you could see your plans on a map if you were running the app on an iPad. With version 1.1 we&#39;ve bought this feature to the iPhone as well. Just look at any of your plans and you&#39;ll find a new toggle to switch between list and map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Translation&lt;/strong&gt; - When browsing reviews, you may come across some that aren&#39;t in English. Just double-tap the review to have it automatically translated!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Navigation&lt;/strong&gt; - If you find yourself jumping from location to location via the trips or nearby spots features, you may find you have to go back through lots screens to get back to the first location you were looking at. You can now just hold down your finger on a back button anywhere in the app to be taken back to the first screen.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report a Problem&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes mistakes are made and old or incorrect data is pulled down through Foursquare or Gowalla. You can now tap a &quot;Report a Problem&quot; button on any location page to have it automatically flagged for us to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are various speed improvements and bug fixes (including an issue with the iPad app not showing all of the screens in certain situations) - there is also the option to send a crash report anonymously in the unlikely event that the app crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everybody who has downloaded the app so far. If you enjoy this update, please leave a review on iTunes. If you run into any problems, please email me via help@highlightsapp.com before leaving a negative review as I&#39;m unable to respond to reviews on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The inside story on powering Highlights</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/07/25/the-inside-story-on-powering-highlights/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/07/25/the-inside-story-on-powering-highlights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I released my latest iOS app, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highlights/id428756645?mt=8&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which is designed to show you the best places in your area or anywhere in the world based on crowd sourced data from Gowalla and Foursquare. In this article, I want to explain how the recommendations engine works and also how I managed to solve some of the biggest challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Search by recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During SXSW 2011, I made the decision to move away from doing development on apps based around Gowalla items and instead to apps based on travelling and discovery (mainly due to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/firewheel/where-are-we-going-sxsw-2011&quot;&gt;excellent talk by Gowalla CEO Josh Williams&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of check-in apps). It was in Austin that I had the idea for Highlights as I was constantly trying to find the best places to eat, drink, or visit as a tourist and finding it hard to choose amongst the variety of locations on offer. I initially decided to do some prototyping based on the Gowalla API to see if I could come up with a way to sort places based on popularity but the API only lets you sort by creation date or number of checkins. In my opinion, the number of people at a place does not form a recommendation - more people probably go to McDonald&#39;s than the local burger joint yet that does not necessarily make it a better choice for dinner. What I needed was a way to filter based on a recently added Gowalla feature; Highlights (from which the name of the app descends). At the time there was no API call to do this (e.g. searching for the &quot;steak&quot; highlight in Austin) so I &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/a67d3106e4a95976&quot;&gt;posted a request on the Gowalla developer boards&lt;/a&gt; - The feature was added as part of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/c7fcf5d9701b088f/e67f9bbc28244a8e?lnk=gst&amp;q=advanced#e67f9bbc28244a8e&quot;&gt;advanced spot search API&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by Andrew Dupont just under a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst toying with the idea of searching by Highlights, I realised that there was a big problem with the way I was going to approach recommendations - whilst Highlights were a definitive recommendation, there just weren&#39;t enough of them being created to power an app of the scale I imagined. It would work great in places where Gowalla use is pervasive (e.g. Austin) but even in a capital city like London searching by Highlights just doesn&#39;t return enough places. What I needed was a way to give a location a score based on a number of criteria such as number of users, highlights, comments, photos, artwork, etc - basically all the data that was available for a spot. The only way that was going to happen was with a huge API change from Gowalla or if I could somehow get a hold of all the data they had...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PubSubHubbub to the rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hub.gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla launched a PubSubHubbub hub&lt;/a&gt; powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://superfeedr.com/&quot;&gt;Superfeedr&lt;/a&gt; that allowed for realtime notifications of checkins either by user or spot. Whereas before you&#39;d have to subscribe to an RSS feed and check it every so often for updates, PubSubHubbub allows for you to subscribe to that feed and have them push the data to you as soon as an update is available. It&#39;s very similar to the difference between checking mail on your iPhone manually or having it pushed to you automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was working on some funky Gowalla item stuff and so I wanted to use realtime notifications so that I could track items around the world. The biggest issue was that I&#39;d need to manually subscribe to each feed which was tricky as there were around 3 million to follow at the time (it would have taken a month for all the subscriptions to go through if I looped through them one at a time and that doesn&#39;t include the work to follow new spots as they&#39;re created). I had been chatting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/julien51&quot;&gt;Julien Genestoux&lt;/a&gt; (CEO and Founder of Superfeedr)  about getting access to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://superfeedr.com/documentation#track&quot;&gt;Track API&lt;/a&gt; which gets around that problem by letting you subscribe to feeds in a much more powerful way (e.g. by keyword, location, or hub). With access to Track, I&#39;d be able to subscribe to every notification, in realtime, that Gowalla pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was whilst chatting to Julien after SXSW that I realised that PubSubHubbub could solve my problems. By using the Track API, my server would be hit with data every time somebody checked in anywhere in the world with Gowalla. I could save that information each time and basically build up my own version of Gowalla&#39;s database that I could search with a custom ranking engine. With the theory solved, it was time to get practical and put everything to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Walrus and The Carpenter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few nights I was able to put my first test version together codenamed &quot;The Walrus&quot; (purely because it uses feeds and I like the way the oysters say &quot;feed&quot; during the story of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nql1_RKwQt0&quot;&gt;The Walrus and The Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in Alice in Wonderland). Its task would be to get the spot information from the data Superfeedr were sending and work out if it was a spot I wanted to keep - I automatically remove a lot of nonsense spots (e.g. Airport Gates, Houses, McDonalds) so there was no sense saving what wasn&#39;t needed. Only a certain amount of data is sent through such as the name and location of the spot and some of its imagery, but I would need a lot more than that so when a spot was saved to the database for the first time, a note was placed on it to tell me to go and get more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as The Walrus was churning through the data was being sent, a script on the server (codenamed &quot;The Carpenter&quot;) would run once a minute and look through the database for any spots with missing data. When it found one, it would go to the Gowalla API and the Foursquare API and get all of the data it needed and then update its record before marking it as suitable for use within the Highlights app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a few revisions (and a massive server upgrade) until everything was running smoothly but it enabled me to process the thousands of checkins that occur every day in realtime. With thousands of checkins coming in every day, I was ready to write an algorithm that would let me search spots based on popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Search by recommendations: Attempt 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I originally started by ranking based on checkins and highlights, I was able to do much more than that with the huge dataset I&#39;d amassed. Every spot is now searched based on a huge range of standard criteria (i.e. number of photos taken at a place) as well as time sensitive information that I have such as frequency between checkins and times of day. This means that a new spot in the area can still be ranked higher than an old place with a huge number of visitors as I can see that it is gaining traction faster and will overtake it at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until June 2011 when the first version of the app was in beta and I was visiting my parents in Devon that I realised a second big problem. Places with few active Gowalla or Foursquare users were showing very few spots. This wasn&#39;t because of a lack of places or data, but just because nobody had checked in anywhere in the last month meant that no alert for me to get the spot data had been sent to &quot;The Carpenter&quot; script. Essentially, whilst my dataset was vast and comprised of millions of active spots, it wasn&#39;t showing those niche places (which are often better) that don&#39;t get checked into as often. Of course, these places would get added the next time someone checked in but I didn&#39;t want to have gaps when the app launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this oversight, if the app finds less than 50 results in the area, it will go and do a manual check with Gowalla and get a basic listing of spots with the rubbish ones removed by the same filter &quot;The Walrus&quot; uses. It adds these to the browse page sorted by checkin but it crucially adds them as &quot;pending&quot; to my database so that &quot;The Carpenter&quot; can check them and rank them for next time. Basically, every time you browse an area, the app learns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reviews and Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than just listing places, I wanted to show more about them when you went through to a detail page. I was able to show a map, address, telephone numbers, and various other bits but the two key areas of information come from Reviews and Photos. With Reviews, a call is made to both the Gowalla and Foursquare APIs in order to get Highlights and Tips from each service and merge them together with the most recent shown first. This gives an excellent and balanced overview of a place that I think works really well. I wanted to add Yelp recommendations as well but unfortunately their API is very poor for matching places or for pulling out recommendations (it limits you to 3 teasers) - I hope to add them in future if their API improves. With Photos, a similar system was used but this time it pulls images from Gowalla, Foursquare, and Flickr thanks to their geolocation API. This again adds a brilliantly balanced view which should always return some results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My database currently has over 1 million locations in hundreds of countries with over 7 million checkins recorded, yet this increases every second of the day as people check-in around the world as well as browsing with the Highlights app. I&#39;m constantly tinkering with the algorithm to make sure it gives the best results as well as finding ways to remove duplicate spots or rogue locations but version 1.1 of the app will make it possible to flag up any issues so they can be cleared up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote Highlights out of a desire to find the best places and I am its biggest user as well as its creator - it has helped me find some great bars as well as finding a dinosaur-themed crazy golf course less than 5km from my house that I knew nothing about! The unique way in which it finds and sorts places means it should be able to find the best places anywhere in the world. In short, I&#39;m confident it will help you whether you are finding places to eat on holiday or are just planning a pub-crawl at university. Give it a try and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; how you get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that amazes me about the iPhone is the way in which it can be used in so many different ways thanks to the power of apps. I&#39;m always interested to see new uses of the technology and so was particularly keen to take a look at GeoWiz which is a new app in the area of teaching. GeoWiz is an app aimed at children to help them make Geography &quot;fascinating and interesting&quot;. It originally started as a board game elementary school project in California before becoming a &quot;social mission software solution&quot; app of which 50% of the apps selling price goes towards supporting schools. With some interesting features such as Game Center integration and a points system, this should be an interesting app in the new medium of digital teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I had a subscription to an excellent magazine called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Wally&#39;s_World!&quot;&gt;Wally&#39;s World&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. It was part of the &quot;Where&#39;s Wally&quot; series and each issue looked at a different country and details such as culture, flags, animals, etc. It was a great way of learning as it was fun, had a few games (mainly word searches), but above all it was easily digestible knowledge. In many ways, I was hoping GeoWiz was going to be something similar with fun games and lots to learn. Unfortunately, that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0017.png&quot; alt=&quot;GeoWiz&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0017.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, lets take a look at what GeoWiz offers. The general premise is a number of games based around memory retention of key facts around Geography, namely continents, countries, capitals, and flags. These games can either be the standard &quot;matching certain objects under revolving tiles&quot; genre or tapping on a country to match it to the capital listed at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0019.png&quot; alt=&quot;Continents Memory&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0019.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0022.png&quot; alt=&quot;Click on the country whose capital is named at the bottom.&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0022.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tile game is pretty good but doesn&#39;t really help you learn anything (after all, you&#39;re matching shapes as quickly as possible, not taking them in). The flag game, on the other hand, is incredible difficult. I had no idea which country had &quot;Brazzaville&quot; as a capital so I just tapped each of the flags as quickly as possible until I found which one it was. There aren&#39;t any point deductions for getting answers wrong so you can win the game fairly quickly just by tapping all over the place. That&#39;s when I found an interesting bug; all of the answers are behind tiles in reverse order. If I tap on the bottom right-hand corner and then move my way right to left up the board, then that appears to be the solution almost every time as demonstrated by the screenshot below showing a perfect score in 3 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0023.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cheating on GeoWiz&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0023.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the gaming, how do you go about learning? Rather than details on each location in the style of an encyclopaedia, countries are just listed out with their flag, name, and capital. There are 4 screens yet each of them are the same just with a different sort order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0029.png&quot; alt=&quot;Learning in GeoWiz&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0029.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapping on a country gives you the same information but a bit larger. However, there are links to other services such as Wikipedia and NatGeo. Unfortunately, these are just inbuilt Safari windows that show no indication of loading and lack the controls of the native browser. It would probably have been better to have external links open in Safari or even to have an &quot;Open in Safari&quot; control for those that want to bookmark or have more control over the browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0032.png&quot; alt=&quot;Looking at a country&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0032.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was willing to put the issues above aside as the app has some interesting credentials in terms of it&#39;s creation and how it is supposed to be used. For example, it contains OpenFeint and Game Center integration to keep children interested in progressing and competing with their friends. I appreciate the idea of adding integration for gaming networks and it&#39;s one of the things that persuaded me to review the app, but the implementation is lacking. There are only 3 achievements and they are all trivial to unlock, especially for the Angry Birds generation. Also, the issues with gameplay I mentioned (e.g. easy to cheat) will make a mockery of the leaderboards very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0039.png&quot; alt=&quot;GeoWiz on Game Center&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0039.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of interest is to use points earned in the games to get pocket money. Again though, the feature is let down by lack of basic UI work. The feature is hard to find and it isn&#39;t immediately obvious how it works or how you set it up - I only knew what it was due to a short description on the iTunes app page. I also have an issue with tying revision into pocket money as this smacks of bad parenting to me. Not being a Father, I can&#39;t really comment but I wouldn&#39;t want my children coming to me with an app and saying &quot;I got 150 points so you owe me £1&quot; especially when it is so easy to game the system. It seems to me that both parent and child would be better served by reading through a child&#39;s atlas together and keeping rewards for when they&#39;ve actually passed a test or school or gained a good grade, not for when they&#39;ve done a bit of revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0035.png&quot; alt=&quot;Points in GeoWiz&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0035.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0036.png&quot; alt=&quot;Account Summary on GeoWiz&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0036.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final area in the app that interested me is the promise that 50% of the app sale price goes to your child&#39;s school. It turns out that you need to find the button to do this (which isn&#39;t obvious) and then choose from a prefilled list of US schools. Whilst I appreciate the intention, it seems a little pointless to me. I&#39;d rather use the 50% (which is £6 or $10) on the pocket money reward or actually giving it directly to my school especially as I&#39;m based in the UK. Also, it would make more sense in my mind for the &quot;choose your school&quot; screen to happen automatically the first time you open the app. That ensures that everyone who uses the app gives a donation and also makes much more sense from a users perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/07/IMG_0037.png&quot; alt=&quot;GeoWiz Donation&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0037.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I&#39;m not terribly impressed with GeoWiz. It has good intentions but the app is severely lacking in polish or finesse. From the app side of things, it doesn&#39;t support the iPhone 4 Retina Display so looks awful on any new devices. This is unacceptable in my mind as adding retina support is trivial, especially for a new app. Aside from technical implementation, there is a distinct lack of structure to the application. The main menu can only be accessed when you first open the app and you can&#39;t go back unless you force quit from the multi-tasking tray. Whilst all of the menu options are available on every page, it&#39;s the fact that you can&#39;t go back to a page you&#39;ve previously seen that doesn&#39;t sit well. Add to this the lack of the regular status bar so you can&#39;t see battery life, network activity, or the time (all important things), poorly laid out navigation controls, and lack of instruction on complex features like points rewards and I can see both children and parents getting frustrated quickly. Yes the games are fun (for a time) but the poor build quality means they are easily cheated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, your child is unlikely to gain much from this app. Geography is not simply knowing what the capital of the Congo is and identifying it&#39;s flag. It&#39;s about culture, the uniqueness of a place, and what we can learn from it. If I had £11.99/$19.99 to spend on teaching my child geography, I&#39;d invest in either a child edition atlas or encyclopaedia and spend some quality time with them telling them about the world. I&#39;m hopeful that one day someone will create an app similar to the &quot;Wally&#39;s World&quot; magazines of my youth as there is real potential for child and parent to learn together (especially with the iPad). However, GeoWiz is not it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0 beta 2. If you have an app for iOS that you would like me to review, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does iOS 5 finally allow retina display iPhone apps to run unscaled on the iPad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the iPad was first launched, one of its original touted features was the ability to run the majority of apps available in the app store (the only ones that wouldn&#39;t work were those requiring a camera but they should now work on the iPad 2). This was a great boon for Apple as they were able to claim that there were hundreds of thousands of apps available at launch but the implementation kinda sucked. Unless the app was a game (which tends to scale quite nicely if built using OpenGL), you&#39;d end up with a pixelly mess. With the launch of the iPhone 4 and Retina Display level apps, I had always assumed that the iPad would get an update to allow it to run Retina Display iPhone apps at their full 960x640 resolution but nothing was forthcoming. So, has this been fixed in iOS 5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, no, nothing has changed at all (as of iOS 5 Beta 1 at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been meaning to write a post about the issue of app scaling a few months ago but what finally pushed me into action (aside from the iOS 5 beta) was an update for one of my favourite games, Peggle, which finally bring Retina Display graphics to the iPhone. It was then that I thought that perhaps Apple had finally gotten Retina Display apps working on the iPad but unfortunately it looks like that isn&#39;t going to be happening. This is a great shame as there are many brilliant iPhone games that have been optimised for the iPhone and would work brilliantly on the iPad, but the developers just haven&#39;t bothered to update them. Peggle is a good case in point so I&#39;m going to use it as a demonstration with some screenshots I&#39;ve knocked up to illustrate my point (note that you can click on the images below to see the real size versions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, here is Peggle running on the iPhone 4 at full Retina Display resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPHONE-RETINA-full.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPHONE-RETINA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 4 with Peggle on a Retina Display&quot; title=&quot;IPHONE-RETINA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty nice! Now let&#39;s take a look at it on the iPad 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-1x-full.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-1x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad running Peggle at 1x resolution&quot; title=&quot;IPAD-NORMAL-1x.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is running at 480x320px black boxed in the middle of the screen. Now this doesn&#39;t look too bad as it would look exactly as the app would on a handset without a Retina Display (that is to say that there would be no pixelation at this size). Obviously it&#39;s awful from a usability point of view (why play a game using less than 25% of your screen?) but the real problem comes when we tap 2x to scale it up to almost full size on the iPad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-2x-full.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-NORMAL-2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad running Peggle at 2x resolution&quot; title=&quot;IPAD-NORMAL-2x.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(it probably doesn&#39;t look too bad in the thumbnail but click to see it at it&#39;s native size and you&#39;ll see the issue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that rather than using the 960x640px assets that are available in the app (as they are used on the iPhone 4), the iPad instead just doubles up the 480x320px version resulting in a fairly fuzzy mess. Seeing as the assets exist in the app already, it should look something more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-WITH-RETINA-full.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IPAD-WITH-RETINA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mockup showing an iPad running Peggle at iPhone 4 Retina Display resolution&quot; title=&quot;IPAD-WITH-RETINA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad (both the original and the iPad 2) are more than powerful enough to cope with it so it can&#39;t be an issue of hardware specs. The only technical problem I could see would be what happens when you scale between 1x and 2x modes (as it would be difficult to have it dynamically switch between the two resolutions). However, my solution would be that if you are running an app updated to Retina Display quality, it should always run at the full size removing the need for the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think the real problem is that Apple don&#39;t want iPhone apps to look good on the iPad. If games like Peggle worked on the iPad at pretty much native resolution, then there would be no incentive for iOS developers to develop solely for the iPad. This isn&#39;t a problem so much for games (aside from losing revenue for games that have &quot;HD&quot; added on the end... I&#39;m looking at you Angry Birds) but it might be for apps like Facebook (not that they&#39;ve bothered making an iPad app anyway). If normal utilities worked at double-resolution, the main argument for developing apps on the iPad would be for UI reasons, and not all iOS developers care about that (though they should).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the iPad is forever going to be limited to running iPhone apps at a scaled resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 22nd June 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben Wetzel emailed me to let me know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpetri.ch/cydia/retinapad/&quot;&gt;RetinaPad&lt;/a&gt;, an app for jailbroken iPads that allows you to run Retina Display iPhone apps at full resolution - it will also scale up common components and text for non-Retina Display apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AirPlay Mirroring, TV Out, and the Apple TV as a games console</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/09/airplay-mirroring-tv-out-and-the-apple-tv-as-a-games-console/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/08/wwdc-2011-keynote-predictions-vs-reality/&quot;&gt;article yesterday following up on the WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that I&#39;d be looking more deeply at the AirPlay Mirroring mode in iOS 5 as it holds a number of interesting surprises. Whilst the ability to mirror the content of the iPad 2 wirelessly to the Apple TV is still impressive, the fact that developers can utilise the existing TV-Out functionality to use the Apple TV as a secondary screen is much more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/24892773&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I look into that, let me go over a brief introduction of what AirPlay Mirroring is and how it works. At the moment, it is only supported on the iPad 2 due to it&#39;s superior CPU (the A5 chip which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/09/ios-5-opens-door-to-true-1080p-apple-tv/&quot;&gt;widely rumoured&lt;/a&gt; to be making an appearance in the next iPhone and next Apple TV allowing for full 1080p resolution... at last). To enable it, all you need to do is go to the usual AirPlay icon hidden in the multi-tasking tray and you&#39;ll find a new option that allows you to enable mirroring mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IMG_0002.png&quot; alt=&quot;AirPlay Mirroring on iOS 5&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0002.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as this is enabled, anything that is displayed on the iPad is instantly displayed on the Apple TV as well. If you rotate the device, the screen rotates on your television as well and it works with every app. If, like me, you&#39;ve been waiting for the BBC to update their iPlayer app to work with AirPlay, you need wait no longer - the mirroring feature works with every single app (with no way of stopping it) as it is baked into the OS so you can stream content from any app to your television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whilst that is impressive, my later discovery has much more potential.  Every since the Apple TV was announced, blogs and forums have been full of people saying &quot;we want apps for the Apple TV&quot;. I have always felt this to be a bad move as a) there is limited space on the Apple TV and b) they would suck. Why, you ask? Well, the Apple TV only comes with a standard Apple Remote with it&#39;s 4 directional buttons, and the &quot;play&quot; and &quot;menu&quot; buttons. This might be good enough for basic browsing through a filesystem (although text entry is a pain) but it&#39;s not conjusive to the sort of experience iOS users have come to expect from their apps. I have always maintained that the best option would be to allow anybody with an iOS device to transmit apps to the Apple TV as a secondary monitor as you can then display content on the big screen and use the iPhone or iPad to control it with touch gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, that&#39;s what Apple have done.. they just haven&#39;t told anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/DSC00952.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AirMaps&quot; title=&quot;DSC00952.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of a test app I built for the iPhone last year called &quot;AirMaps&quot;. Originally, I used an iPad-to-VGA adapter to plug the iPhone into my screen. The app was a simple trackpad that allowed you to manipulate Google Maps on the television. It works well enough with pinch, double-tap, etc, but having to plug in via a cable was always going to be arduous.  However, now with the AirPlay mirroring &lt;strong&gt;any app with TV-Out functionality will automatically broadcast it&#39;s secondary screen to the Apple TV&lt;/strong&gt;. This is exactly what I&#39;ve been talking about for the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now&quot;, you might say, &quot;that all looks rather fancy, but what are the real world implications&quot;. In a word, gaming. This feature, unmentioned though it has been, is going to bring iOS gaming to a new level. With this functionality, you can now turn the Apple TV into a games console (and a particular cheap one at that when you consider hardware and software costs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of example, I have loaded up &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-incident/id385533456?mt=8&quot;&gt;The Incident&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on my iPad 2 and iPhone. This game made some headlines a few months ago when it announced it was adding TV-Out in a rather special way. You could plug your iPad into the television with the cable, but then use WiFi on the iPhone to control the iPad app (which in turn was broadcast to the television). This was much better than the previous route but still meant you needed 2 iOS devices and a £50 cable. Now with AirPlay Mirroring on iOS 5, this functionality works out of the box without the need for the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/DSC00951.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;The Incident&quot; over AirPlay&quot; title=&quot;DSC00951.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad is connected wirelessly to the AppleTV thanks to AirPlay mirroring, and the iPhone is connected to the iPad over WiFi to enable it to work as a controller. Amazingly (considering it&#39;s running at 720p), the whole thing works incredibly quickly and responsively.  Obviously, this setup is rather convuluted (as you still need an iPad 2 and an iPhone) but there are other apps that will work with just an iPad 2. For example, you can now present using Keynote wirelessly (the iPad will display your presenter notes whilst the AppleTV shows the slides) but you can also play games like Real Racing 2 HD completely wirelessly using your iPad as a controller. This is truly remarkable stuff and something that I know is going to be huge once iOS 5 comes out in a few months time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a brief video to demo this a little better but please feel free to get in touch on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or via &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day before the WWDC 2011 keynote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/06/wwdc-2011-predictions-ios-5-lion-and-icloud/&quot;&gt;I posted an article&lt;/a&gt; with a number of predictions that I was making along with a promise to do a follow up to see how accurate that was. Having now watched the keynote video and had a chance to play around with iOS 5.0 (on both models of iPad and the iPhone 4), I&#39;m now ready to take a look at what I believe are the most exciting changes coming around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;h3&gt;iOS 5.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple did pretty much as expected by introducing a whole new notifications system. It was not, as I&#39;d hoped, a part of the wasted screen space currently used for search but copied completely from Android by using a swipe-down gesture from the status bar. I&#39;m still not convinced that this is the best place for it (as new users won&#39;t know to swipe-down from the top of the screen - there is no indication anything is up there) so we might see it move before iOS 5 gets made public. In terms of how notifications work, it is a similar system to Game Center with a nice Growl-style overlay appearing at the top of the screen - this is tappable to go direct to the app or you can ignore it and look at it in the Notification Center overlay. One thing I will say about notifications is that the customisable options are incredibly good - each app can be customised so you can have notifications show up in the old modal style (I do this for txts), the banner style, or not at all. You can also choose whether they appear in the Notification Center, on the Lock Screen, and how many notifications an app is allowed to display. This was unexpected from me as Apple doesn&#39;t usually give you the option to personalise - whilst there is a lot of complexity in what can be done, they have laid it out in the settings in a very clear fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IMG_0017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Notification Center Options&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0017.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &quot;View in Lock Screen&quot;, this was something else I&#39;d thought might be available. Notifications stack up in the unused space as they come in but the really nice touch is that you can slide a notification (just like the unlock slider) in order to go direct to that app. For example, if you had notifications for txts, emails, and Twitter, you could slide the email notification to go direct to that email. It&#39;s a minor thing, but saves a huge amount of time and is more effective than going to the app that last sent you a notification which was the default unlock action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of widgets, there was a lot less than I had anticipated. Whilst there are widgets, there are only two of them and they&#39;re hardly exciting; weather and stocks. Thankfully, they can be turned off in the settings if you don&#39;t want them. If enabled, they reside at the top of the Notification Center which is as good a place as any but there is no option to put them on either the home screen or the lock screen. I disabled stocks (as I have little interest in them) but I&#39;ve had weather enabled for the past 2 days. The unique feature they&#39;ve added is localisation in that it uses the GPS to show you the weather where you are - sure enough, it flips between London and Surbiton depending on if I&#39;m at home or in the office. But what is the point of the feature? I looked out the window earlier to see it was raining - the widget qualified this by also saying it was raining. It would be far more useful to have a widget that shows weather at a specific location (e.g. is it raining in London whilst I&#39;m at home) rather than what the weather is doing at your current location. Also, whilst you can swipe the weather to get a forecast it doesn&#39;t remember this setting the next time you look at it (so I&#39;m always having to swipe to see the bit that could be of interest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/IMG_0019.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weather Widget, iOS 5&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0019.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see the ability to create widgets at some point, but probably not for the launch of iOS 5. Adding the ability for 3rd party devs to create them (i.e. having a Facebook widget) would be a good move in my opinion and would be even better if they could be added to the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from widgets and the notification positions, the rest of my iOS 5 predictions were on the mark. Wireless syncing with iTunes is in complete with delta updates (so you no longer need to download 500MB update every time they update the OS). As a bonus, when syncing with iTunes, you can still use the phone even if you are plugged in via a cable. This makes a huge difference as getting a txt just before you start a half hour import of all your music is very tedious! Game Center saw a number of improvements and the new iCloud functionality allows for the saving of game state as I suggested. No word yet that FaceTime is working on 3G but that may happen before we get to the end of the beta period. Also, Apple quite often add additional functionality before going Gold Master so it&#39;s quite plausible that things will move around and we&#39;ll see the introduction of improved voice control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting piece which I hadn&#39;t seen coming was the introduction of iMessage. This is basically a silent update to the Messages app so that when you are sending a message to somebody else who has an iOS device, it does it through your internet connection for free rather than via SMS or MMS. This is a genius move (and bound to annoy the people at RIM and the mobile carriers) as it means you can now use an iPod Touch as an iPhone when on WiFi (as you have iMessages and FaceTime). The UI works incredibly well with the colour of the speech bubbles and some minor differences in text to differentiate between a free message and a paid message. It also automatically updates on all of your devices so you have all of your conversations no matter whether you are using an iPad or iPhone. All in all, a very good update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;d thought, there wasn&#39;t a lot to say about Lion although they did spend half an hour going over all of the pieces that had already been demoed in the past. The most interesting announcement was that Lion was going to retail for $29.99 and would only be available via the Mac App Store. This is another bold move from Apple but there are a lot of details left open (which my Twitter feed is full off!) such as &quot;what happens if I want to reinstall from scratch&quot; and &quot;what if I have no internet connection&quot;. I&#39;m sure Apple will address these in good time but my gut feeling is that Lion will update the BIOS on your machine in order that you can install from the Mac App Store. At the moment, holding &quot;cmd&quot; allows you to boot from CD, USB, or over WiFi network from another machine so it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch for that WiFi support to expand to connect to the Mac App Store to download the OS. Lion also creates a backup partition from which it can restore itself so that would solve many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last article I did briefly mention that AirDrop might be expanded to allow wireless file sharing with iOS 5 - as iOS 5 didn&#39;t get an updated file system, this didn&#39;t materialise but it might be something that appears in later versions (e.g. iOS 5.2). The other speculation I had was that iBooks would make it to the desktop - again, this didn&#39;t happen but iTunes has been updated (for Snow Leopard users as well) so that you can now purchase books on the desktop and have them automatically sent to your iOS devices (with support for iOS 4.3 available now as well). This is a good step but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see iBooks in the Mac App Store soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iCloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the one piece that nobody knew much about and was therefore the most anticipated - it certainly didn&#39;t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody had agreed beforehand that there would be some sort of iTunes-sync system so that you would be able to access your iTunes library everywhere. Unfortunately, I hadn&#39;t thought that this would be US only (in that you still can&#39;t redownload your purchased music outside of the US). This is most likely due to the legal licenses required and, if past experience is anything to go by, it will most likely be 6-12 months before we see sight of that here in the UK. However, the fact that it&#39;s coming is noteworthy in itself and is a good push for the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, iTunes Match was the showstopping announcement. A service whereby your music is scanned, uploaded (if they don&#39;t have it already), and then shared to all devices for $24.99 a year... oh, and that includes any MP3s from other locations (e.g. Amazon, Google, Bittorrent). How they managed to make the music industry accept that I&#39;ll never know but it is an amazing announcement to make. I particularly like the way they&#39;ve compared the service with rivals Amazon and Google on the official website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-08-at-15.14.04.png&quot; alt=&quot;There&#39;s iCloud. And then there&#39;s everything else.&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-08 at 15.14.04.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still no sign of a subscription iTunes deal (i.e. pay $9.99 a month and get free streaming access to all iTunes content) but I&#39;m sure that will be appearing at some point in the next year now that they&#39;ve made such headway with iTunes Match (which is a much bigger legal minefield).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the rest of iCloud, it was pretty much as I&#39;d had it on my wish list. Completely free syncing of all your information between all devices along with 3rd party APIs so your apps can sync state as well. The API looks well thought out and very easy to use so I&#39;m sure uptake will be strong from other developers. Making it completely free across the board was also a brilliant move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;One More Thing...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had speculated that there would be a &quot;one more thing&quot; which would deal with the Apple TV. My dream has been for developers to be able to use the Apple TV as a secondary screen for their apps rather than using a component cable plugged into a HDTV (which works, but isn&#39;t a graceful solution). Whilst it wasn&#39;t mentioned, the Keynote did have one slide showing &quot;AirPlay Mirroring&quot; which turns out to be a solution just for the iPad 2 allowing you to mirror everything on the screen to your Apple TV. This isn&#39;t AirPlay, this is fully baked in mirroring of all apps with no way for developers to disable it (so I can finally watch BBC iPlayer on my Apple TV). It&#39;s not without flaws at the moment (quite jerky probably as rendering on two screens - it could turn off the iPad screen really but doesn&#39;t) but I&#39;m sure these will be ironed out before launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mirroring goes further than that as if you are using an app which supports TV-Out (e.g. Keynote), then turning mirroring on treats the Apple TV as a secondary screen. I&#39;m not sure why they didn&#39;t make a big deal out of this future as it is a game changer - you can now play games like &quot;The Incident&quot; on your TV wirelessly from your device and it works incredibly well. I built a little proof-of-concept mapping application which put a trackpad on my iPad and Google Maps on the Apple TV and it works brilliantly - I&#39;ll be posting an article about this soon...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve now posted an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/09/airplay-mirroring-tv-out-and-the-apple-tv-as-a-games-console/&quot;&gt;AirPlay Mirroring, TV Out, and the Apple TV as a games console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the WWDC 2011 Keynote was one of the best Keynotes in recent years. Whilst the 30 minute ramble about Lion (which we&#39;d already seen) probably wasn&#39;t necessary, the low price-point and Mac App Store only made it interesting. iOS 5 is a massive leap forward with a number of very interesting features (including custom text message tones.. finally!) and iCloud is going to be an incredible revolution once 3rd party apps get updated to use it. As a user, I&#39;m excited by the new software coming out, but I&#39;m even more excited as a developer. There is a huge amount of documentation to go through but what I&#39;ve seen so far has been nothing short of exceptional. It looks like 2011 is going to be another great year for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been watching Apple keynotes with a keen interest for many, many years and I usually make a number of predictions; some correct, some completely off the mark. However, this is the first time I&#39;ve decided to publish my thoughts prior to a keynote. I don&#39;t claim that all of these things will come true -- some of them are just on my wishlist -- but I will come back to this list tomorrow to see how accurate I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/06/08/wwdc-2011-keynote-predictions-vs-reality/&quot;&gt;follow up article&lt;/a&gt; is now available with details of the WWDC Keynote and how my predictions panned out.   
The most crucial thing about the core Apple products -- Macs, iPhones, iPads, and iPods -- is not the hardware. There are cheaper, faster components for personal computers, there are lighter more powerful smartphones, and I dare say we&#39;ll see some tablets soon which make the iPads engorged iPod Touch design feel dated. Whilst they are all aesthetically pleasing, the hardware is actually fairly underwhelming (aside from a few innovations such as the Retina Display). What makes Apple products so desirable is the software and it is for that reason that I think WWDC 2011 is going to be one of the most important conferences in recent years. With major updates for iOS and OS X at the same time, Apple has everything to gain if it gets it right, and a lot to lose if it gets it wrong. Throw into the mix a pre-announcement on cloud technology, and we could yet be surprised by what was generally perceived to be a keynote which would lack anything completely unexpected. Apple have released a press announcement and plastered the Moscone Center in posters showing that WWDC 2011 = iOS 5, Mac OS X Lion, and iCloud. For that reason, I&#39;ll take a look at each one in turn to give my predictions on what we might see announced tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iOS 5.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely the highlight for me (as an iOS developer), I firmly believe that iOS 5 is going to be the biggest update to iOS since iOS 2.0 added the App Store. Why? Up until this point, iOS has been a leader in both innovation and in user experience. However, the home screens are now feeling dated and Android, Windows Phone 7, and WebOS are now creeping up in terms of features and UI (especially in the area surrounding notifications, widgets, and tiles). So, what will Apple add to iOS 5?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Notifications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notifications system in the current versions of iOS is pretty shameful when stacked up against the competition. Alerts come in one at a time and overwrite previous alerts (for example, if my app sends 2 pushes, you&#39;ll only see the second one. If another app sends a push, you won&#39;t even see mine just theirs). The advent of local notifications, push notifications, and badge icons worked well as a stopgap for true multitasking, but the horrible modal UI just doesn&#39;t feel right on a phone anymore when consumers are getting more used to seeing unobtrusive notifications. When you start getting issues such as a push notification overlaying the phone panel (so you have to close a push before you can hang up on someone), the system is obviously broken. I expect this will be one of the major tentpoles of iOS 5 and we&#39;ll see a notifications system more similar to a cross between Android and Growl. On Android, you can pull down the status bar to see a list of all notifications and every app that has an unread notification is visible in the status bar as a small icon. There are notifications for new emails, tethering, available wi-fi hotspots, and 3rd party apps (e.g. new tweets). However, they are totally unobtrusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think this will be copied verbatim as the UI convention doesn&#39;t work (how many users know to pull down the status bar?). What I think more likely is that the search dialogue (swipe to the right from the first home screen) will be replaced with search and notifications. At the moment, the keyboard slides up automatically to take up half the screen and the search box takes up about 50px at the top. If the keyboard didn&#39;t come up, there would be a large amount of space to list notifications in a similar way to search results (e.g. by app with a badge or other count to show notification titles) with one-touch access to the application in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you know when you have notifications? I would guess that there will be an Android-similar status bar icon but that there will also be Growl-style notifications in-app. These are already used for Game Center (ever noticed when you start up a Game Center enabled app that you&#39;ll get a dialogue slide in from the top saying &quot;Welcome back, username&quot;?) so it&#39;s not a stretch to expect that they would be available, and tappable, for 3rd party notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Home Screens / Widgets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home screens have been the same on iOS since version 1.0 and are now feeling slightly dated, especially when you consider the number of apps available on the App Store. iOS 4 saw the introduction of folders and 11 screens worth of apps (meaning you can install over 2000 apps) but this still seems a way of adding more rather than making it easy to prioritise. I love the folders system, but there are other players now who are doing this better. Ashamedly, Microsoft are one of them with their tiles system which is integral to both Windows Phone 7 and the recently previewed Windows 8. It is most likely that the home screens will stay as they are but a new dashboard system (or perhaps &quot;Mission Control&quot; to keep in with Lion branding... see later) will be added in order to add one or two screens of your most-used apps. This might come in the form of a gesture, an app, or just being the default landing page after you unlock the phone (with another swipe necessary to take you to all apps) but I think it likely we&#39;ll see some changes to how apps can be organised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me nicely into Widgets which are another thing which has been popular for a while, both in OS X in the form of Dashboard, and on Android phones. On Android, some apps can drop widgets onto the home screen so you can have a space (maybe 4 app icons by 2 app icons in size) that shows you your Facebook updates or a wall clock, etc. The problems are that on Android there are no design conventions so they generally look awful - they also take up far too many system resources (e.g. the Facebook app used up 10% of my battery on average due to the way in which it checked for updates). I would expect Apple to solve both of these problems in a graceful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last word on the home screen - I don&#39;t expect them to be gotten rid of or for widgets and apps to coincide (as on Android). The reason for this is that OS X Lion has an app overlay modelled on iOS but maintains its dashboard separately (interestingly with a swipe to the right from the apps page as per my suggestion for notifications). Whilst this &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be an interesting tactic by Apple to lull us into a false sense of security (e.g. Lion beta has iOS home screens therefore home screens aren&#39;t changing but actually they are *dun dun daaaaaaaa*) I doubt it. I expect the home screen to remain as it is but for there to be a new dashboard screen to replace the first home screen (or some other way of accessing a widget laced dashboard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Lock Screen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavily connected to both of the above, the lock screen needs an overhaul. A system which combines notifications and widgets would be best (so you can see, without unlocking your phone) how many emails, texts, and Twitter mentions you have as well as seeing what the weather is like in your area) but I think it&#39;s linked fairly intrinsically to the home screen system. It could be that the &quot;Dashboard&quot; I mention above is in fact the lock screen with home screens being unchanged but I think that would be a mistake - you can&#39;t add too much to the lock screen as the whole purpose is for it to have no touch input (incase it is activated by accident). Having a list of your notifications (so you can see if that *bing* was a notification of a baseball game starting or a new email) would be an excellent addition, but loading it up with touchable widgets would not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of updates available to iOS; app updates and system updates. At present, both suck and for pretty much the same reasons. The first major problem is incremental updating. If you want to update your device or an app, you have to download a whole new version of the software (which can be hundreds of megabytes in the case of system software and games) when there may only be a handful of lines of code changed. I don&#39;t think that 3rd party apps will get the ability to do incremental updates yet (as I imagine this to be hard to implement and check for Apple and developers) but there is no reason why iOS software can&#39;t be updated in this way - OS X has been doing it for years with full combo updates available to download when things go completely wrong. The other issue (for iOS updates at least) is that you need to be tethered to iTunes. This wasn&#39;t an issue for iPods as it was generally accepted that you need to be connected to iTunes to add music so doing updates through it is logical. However, iTunes is now a bloated mess, dealing with a multitude of media and updating. It is no longer suitable for updating things like phones and post-PC devices (the iPad). iOS devices need the ability to update themselves without being linked to a computer and iOS 5 is the time to make that happen (in fact it has already been discovered that this is on the cards thanks to an over-zealous copyeditor on iTunes). The update to iOS 5 will be done in the old fashioned way but I expect that updating to iOS 5.1 (or 5.0.1) will be able to be done independently from a PC (and hopefully over a 3G connection if incremental updates are issued).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about software updates on iOS, check out my post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/02/11/mobile-os-updates-android-vs-ios/&quot;&gt;iOS updates vs Android updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other areas that could use improving but these are all fairly minor in comparison with the design overhauls above. Maps would do well to be updated as it pales in comparison to Android but this is largely in the hands of Google (see the problem there?) until Apple break away with their own mapping solution. I was hoping that would happen this time around but from the rumours flying around it would seem that we are going to be stuck with Google as the only built-in mapping solution for at least the next year. Game Center is another tool which needs a radical overhaul in order to make it relevant. Adding a gamification layer equivalent to Xbox Live seemed a good idea but Achievements are half-baked (you can&#39;t see a total gamerscore as per Xbox Live) and the interface is, well, horrible. Now that there are Universal apps, it would make sense for game progress to be syncable (although I&#39;ll come to this in the iCloud section below) as there is nothing more frustrating that having to play a game twice on two separate devices (or on one as if you do a restore on your phone you lose your app data). The file system is something which could do with a tweak as syncing pages documents to iOS devices is quite painful through iTunes - this is something more likely to be solved by iCloud but the actual process of accessing files on the device may well be changed. Finally, there are things like &quot;read it later&quot; which we already know are coming to Safari (I bet Instapaper are happy about that) as well as minor updates to each of the major apps bundled with iOS so that Steve can say &quot;there are over 100 updates&quot; or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, the main basis of iOS 5 should be about a fundamental rethink of how apps are accessed and used. Whilst apps and the home screen system were revolutionary, they are now 4 years old and showing their age - it&#39;s time for an update which allows for unobtrusive notifications, easy access to app information via widgets, and lightweight updates available everywhere. Getting FaceTime to work on 3G (as promised) would also be a nice touch seeing as Skype has been doing it for months...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to say a huge amount about Lion as I think we&#39;ve seen the majority of the biggest pieces in the numerous developer previews (which despite NDA have been demoed extensively on YouTube and Apple Rumour sites as well as on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/&quot;&gt;official Apple website&lt;/a&gt;). There is obviously a huge UI overhaul with Mission Control and Launchpad as well as bring a number of other innovations from iOS (reverse scrolling, iOS scrollbars, new segmented controls, overhauled calendar interface, etc) but the most exciting things for me are Mail, Auto Save, Versions, and AirDrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The built-in Mail app has been lacking for a little while, especially now that competitors such as Sparrow are taking a lot of the limelight on the Mac App Store. With Lion, Mail is becoming more like the iPad version which for me is one of the nicest email clients around. Apple will claim &quot;conversations&quot; as a big step forward but the truth is that Gmail has been doing it for a very, very long time (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through&quot;&gt;10 years or so in fact&lt;/span&gt; It was actually 7 years as Gmail started up in 2004 - thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattydsmith/status/77650864956907520&quot;&gt;@mattydsmith&lt;/a&gt; for the correction). However, it is a welcome improvement. I for one haven&#39;t got on well with Sparrow (bit too buggy for me at the moment) so I&#39;m looking forward to the new version of Mail just for a few of the most basic improvements like conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Auto Save&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like iOS apps, Mac apps will now be built to take advantage of &quot;auto save&quot; - basically, whenever you change something, it is saved automatically rather than when you press the floppy disk icon (maybe this is the death of that button at last?). To be fair, this has existed for a long time in the OS itself (e.g. when you are in System Settings, you never save anything apart from when you apply network settings - everything is saved as soon as you change a toggle) and apps have faked it with autosaves (even Office does that) but this is the first time that support is baked into the OS making it a lot more efficient and reliable. A minor feature, maybe, but one that I&#39;m sure will be welcomed by anybody that has lost data due to power failure or human error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Versions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related in many ways to Auto Save, Versions is basically Time Machine for files. Every time you alter a file, a backup is stored away somewhere so you can go back in time and get that version you wished you hadn&#39;t overwritten by accident. This has happened to be from time to time (especially when I get overzealous with my copy-paste commands and overwrite something I didn&#39;t mean to but then do something to break the &quot;undo&quot; button) so this will be another welcome addition. To an extent, I have this already for most of my work material as I have the packrat addition for Dropbox (which means every single file in my Dropbox is versioned automatically) but it will be nice to have the feature when I&#39;m not connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;AirDrop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature that hasn&#39;t been mentioned much in the press is AirDrop, a way for you to share files easily between computers. Basically, with two computers near each other, opening up AirDrop will allow you to share files without any of the usual network hoops such as Bluetooth handshakes or passwords. Whilst this could be done already if you have setup file sharing, the point is that it works out of the box. The reason I&#39;m excited about it is because I expect it to be compatible with iOS 5 so you can very easily share files between your Mac and iPhone / iPad without a) tethering via a cable or b) iTunes. Definitely something to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, I would expect there to be a few new headline features announced tomorrow for Lion. iWork is well overdue for an update and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch of the imagination to expect iBooks to make its way to the desktop (or at least the iBooks store). Ideally I&#39;d like to see iTunes completely rebuilt as separate apps with the Mac App Store becoming the place for Mac and iOS apps (maybe even Universal apps that run on all devices - e.g. download Twitter and it will work on iPhone, iPad, and Mac with one binary.. no reason it can&#39;t be done. I&#39;m not saying iOS apps running on Mac OS X, just that the Mac version could be bundled so for one payment you get all 3 versions). iTunes should be an audio playback utility (and store) only with Quicktime taking over TV Shows and Movies and iBooks managing your ebooks. It astounds me that everything is still controlled from iTunes. Do I expect it to be updated tomorrow? Realistically, no. iTunes updates tend to come with iPod updates in September but I&#39;d still hope that at some point (and Lion would be the best time to do it) that some parts of iTunes could be split out to other apps. This was one thing that iOS does very well (e.g. the iPod app doesn&#39;t control everything) so taking this &quot;back to the mac&quot; would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iCloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the big unknown quantity. What is iCloud? Apple have made the unprecedented move of announcing the name (and the icon) ahead of the announcement although this was most likely to stop people wondering if the iPhone 4S (or iPhone 5) would be announced or not (hint: it won&#39;t be). Most bets are on iCloud being a storage locker for music so that you can stream your iTunes library but there are a lot better things that can be done. I&#39;ve broken them down by type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Music&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with music, it is generally accepted that iCloud is going to be heavily tied to iTunes. Music labels have apparently done deals with Apple so that streaming will be enabled but the real question is on implementation. Consensus appears to be that your iTunes purchases will be available to stream from Apple&#39;s servers to your iOS devices and Macs wherever you are. There would be no upload (as they have the master copies) and there is some advantage to this approach in that you don&#39;t need to have your iPhone synced with your 20GB library - you can just stream as and when you need it. The downside is a) you need to have purchased from iTunes (fair enough) and b) you need an internet connection. Apple tends to introduce new systems which are essentially crippled at launch and then build them up over time so I&#39;d expect that the above is true and pretty much the extent of the music portion of iCloud. In future, we&#39;ll be able to upload our own MP3s to stream and cache things offline, etc, but for now it is most likely to be just previous iTunes purchases (although this is good news for me as I have many iTunes purchases which were lost due to a nonexistent backup strategy and now have to be re-bought as iTunes doesn&#39;t allow you to re-download music for free like it does with apps). I expect Apple to also launch a Spotify rival in the form of a monthly subscription to get streaming (and maybe offline caching) of iTunes content but this is more likely to come in September with new iPods and a new version of iTunes than at this announcement. I&#39;ll happily be wrong on that issue though as whilst I love Spotify, its library of music is nowhere near as comprehensive as Apple&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Files&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iDisk sucks. I don&#39;t know anybody who thinks otherwise. I also don&#39;t know anybody who uses a Mac who doesn&#39;t use Dropbox. This is a problem for Apple and one it needs to sort out fast. With their fancy new data centre and OS X Lion, there is no reason why they can&#39;t rule the online file storage space (especially if they tie it in with Versions and Time Machine along with fancy new routers to do the whole thing without your Mac being on). For this to work, there is one key requirement - uploading must be fast and easy (iDisk seems to take an age) and files need to be accessible everywhere (by which I mean, on iOS). That&#39;s pretty much it, nothing revolutionary. The keynote part of this will probably revolve around new Time Capsules and Airport Extremes which allow for your mac to sync incredibly quickly with their internal hard drives and then for the router to sync with the cloud whilst your computer is off. This is better for the environment and uses less resources on the Mac (as Dropbox hogs all memory and CPU cycles if you have a lot of updates to do) but I expect it to be an optional extra - obviously you&#39;ll be able to use file sharing on iCloud without an Apple router, it&#39;ll just be better if you have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Apps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing that iCloud could do would be to open itself up as a 3rd party API. This would allow app developers who don&#39;t have access to servers and web technology (which is a lot of them bearing in mind most come from software development backgrounds, not web development like me) to sync their data between their own apps with minimal hassle. A good example of this is Things, a to-do list app by Cultured Code. It&#39;s a fantastic app but its main failing is that there is not yet a public way for you to sync content over the internet between iOS apps (e.g. iPad and iPhone) or to the Mac (e.g. iPhone to Mac or Mac to Mac). It can be done with WiFi and they are working on cloud-sync solutions, but with a 3rd party API this would have been done already. Another good example is games like Angry Birds in which you lose your progress if you wipe your iPhone or switch to your iPad (or upgrade from an iPhone 3GS to an iPhone 4). With a 3rd party API, developers could sync game save data to the cloud ready for it be downloaded on all of your devices so you never again lose your high scores. Developers win as their apps become more intuitive and cohesive and consumers win as they now have an ecosystem for their devices which maintains their data without them thinking about it. If anything, I would say that this is the biggest potential area for iCloud and I really hope to see this announced tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;MobileMe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final area of iCloud is the takeover of MobileMe. I think it&#39;s fairly safe to say that MobileMe won&#39;t exist after tomorrow and will be absorbed by iCloud. However, there are updates that need to happen. At £59 a year, it&#39;s overpriced for a system which most people only use to sync their address books and calendars. Free email has been around for years (with Gmail having a superior offering), Flickr is better than the photo syncing and Dropbox is better than iDisk - the only thing worth having (aside from contact / iCal sync) is Find My iPhone which was recently made free for new iOS devices anyway. I won&#39;t speculate on pricing for iCloud (as we don&#39;t know what it is yet) but I&#39;d expect that the syncing aspects will be free for anyone with OS X Lion or iOS devices in future (and just a nominal fee, around the $30 mark, for everyone else). The cost advantage of having syncing between all devices will net Apple more profit (just from apps and devices) than charging for that syncing service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;One More Thing...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one other thing that I&#39;ve been predicting for a while and I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll see a push in the right direction tomorrow; Apple TV Apps. When I say apps, I don&#39;t mean native apps on the Apple TV. That won&#39;t work for the simple reason that the Apple TV only comes bundled with a basic remote which provides very little control for things more advanced than the YouTube app that comes bundled (and that&#39;s bad enough when it comes to text entry). No, what I mean is that iOS 5 apps on iPhone and iPad should be allowed to use the Apple TV as a secondary screen. APIs exist for this (in a way) with a cable in that an iPad-to-VGA adapter can let you display your apps on a secondary monitor (e.g. using the Keynote app you can display your presentation on a projector and notes on your iPad) and the iPad 2 introduced mirroring mode allowing you to play games at HD resolution on your TV with the component cable. However, I want to be able to play something like Real Racing wirelessly with my iPhone providing the app and acting as a wireless steering wheel, yet transmitting the data to the TV so that the Apple TV can display the game. There are issues to solve with lag (especially in HD gaming) but these could be solved by having an app payload sent over to the TV and cached locally as part of an initial load (kind of like buffering a movie) and then the remote only sending light data packets with control information. As an example, use the Apple Remote app with an Apple TV and you&#39;ll find it highly responsive - you can scroll and tap on the iPhone to control the Apple TV and it all works in real time. Just imagine if you could transmit your Keynote presentation wirelessly and then control it in the same way or play Angry Birds on the big screen. Throw in a built-in version of Game Center and suddenly Apple will be up against the entrenched console systems in the living room - you wouldn&#39;t even need to change the name AirPlay as the &quot;play&quot; could be about gaming rather than just AV playback. I&#39;ve been talking about this ever since the iPad was launched but I think now is the time it could become a reality - it&#39;s a long shot but we&#39;ll see tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, tomorrow could be one of the many defining moments in Apple&#39;s history. If iOS 5 gets enough of a redesign to keep it fresh when compared to the newcomers, if OS X Lion launches soon with more upgrades than those previewed, and if iCloud introduces true syncing between them, then it will set the tone for Apple for the next 5 years. However, if iCloud is anything like the MobileMe launch (e.g. a shambles), then things will turn out very differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; any major announcements as they happen and I&#39;ll chuck up a summary post tomorrow to see how many of my predictions have come true. In the meantime, if you have any opinions, fire me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;drop me an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been just over a year since I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;WikiLocation&lt;/a&gt;, a simple REST-ful API to access geocoded Wikipedia articles.  During that time, hundreds of developers have made use of the API in mashups, apps, and commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&#39;m happy to announce that I&#39;ve added locale support to the WikiLocation API. This means that the API now provides access to over &lt;strong&gt;3.8 million geocoded articles across 36 different languages&lt;/strong&gt;. The following languages are now supported via a simple &quot;locale&quot; parameter which can be added to any API call (full details can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;WikiLocation API Documentation&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tr.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 9,448 articles&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these new articles and language filters, I have also updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;WikiLocation.org website&lt;/a&gt; with a new visual design which should make it easier to find critical information. Finally, the API has been relocated to a new dedicated server to provide even faster access for your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback or questions relating to the API, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One year on: further thoughts on the Gowalla API</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/12/one-year-on-further-thoughts-on-the-gowalla-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the one-year anniversary of a letter I put together entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gowallatools.com/api/&quot;&gt;Thoughts on the Gowalla API&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, a very critical look at the ever-changing API provided for the popular location-based service.  The article was picked up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/12/gowalla-api-problems/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.apigee.com/detail/api_design_rules/&quot;&gt;mentioned at conferences&lt;/a&gt; and events but I also like to think that it prompted a few changes. In this post, I want to revisit some of the points I made and hopefully highlight some of the changes that have come about as well showing where further improvements could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first put the post together, I was running a service called Gowalla Tools and coming up against constant changes to the API and a very unresponsive developer community.  I decided to put the tools and services I was building on indefinite hiatus whilst I waited for some changes to take place.  The most important of these was putting in place a process of notifying API developers when changes were going to happen rather than making them and only occasionally sending out a notification a few days later. Fortunately this is now the case and Gowalla have assembled a fantastic team of developers who are constantly available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev&quot;&gt;Gowalla Developers Google Group&lt;/a&gt;. The big changes really started to happen in August 2010 when &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gowalla.com/post/977720465/hello-3rd-party-apps-gowalla-checks-in-with-oauth&quot;&gt;Gowalla announced that their OAuth 2.0 implementation&lt;/a&gt; was now complete and you could now make secure authenticated calls including the ability to check users in at a spot (something which hadn&#39;t existed up until that point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once OAuth 2.0 was introduced, I started to play around with the API again and launched a new service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;Wallabee&lt;/a&gt; in September.  The first application was entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/apps/travel-edition/&quot;&gt;Wallabee: Travel Edition&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and allowed users to check-in using over 95% less data than the official app making it a) much faster and b) a lot cheaper when you are travelling overseas.  The app was a big success, frequently appearing in the &quot;What&#39;s Hot&quot; section of the App Store, and several of the Gowalla employees have used it whilst travelling. Over Christmas I made a number of announcements about future app plans and in March 2011 I, along with a number of contributors, launched The Wallabee Pouch. It was a new player guide, a directory of information, and home to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/directory/&quot;&gt;The Item Directory&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and most up-to-date repository of Gowalla items.  This was all made possible due to an API that no longer changed and the incredibly helpful advice provided by many of the Gowalla Developers. I&#39;d like to personally thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amcmanus/&quot;&gt;Adam McManus&lt;/a&gt; who provided a lot of advice and support whilst I was working on The Item Directory, probably the biggest drain on their API at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to SXSW in March and was very privileged to meet the Gowalla team and spend some time chatting to their developers. I also listened to some incredibly powerful talks by &lt;a href=&quot;http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP6984&quot;&gt;Josh Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5756&quot;&gt;Jon Carroll&lt;/a&gt; which made me make some fundamental changes to the way I was working with Gowalla - you can read all about that on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/&quot;&gt;SXSW and Gamification post&lt;/a&gt;.  It eventually led to me handing over Wallabee to another developer so I could focus on some of my own Gowalla apps that were focussed on the story and travelling elements of the service rather than the item and game based sections, but I&#39;ll get back to this shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accept that changes have to happen but these just need to be conveyed to developers in a better way. We propose that any changes be submitted to the Gowalla Developer Group at least 1 week in advance of a change so that we can update our code as necessary. We also suggest that a “version” parameter be added across the API so that legacy scripts can continue to work without changes. In this way, a developer can move to the next API version to take advantage of any new features and data but won’t risk having their hard work undone by what could be a very minor change (e.g. renaming a parameter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the biggest area of improvement that the Gowalla API has undergone. This time last year, parameters were changed without consultation and code breakage was a frequent distraction. Now however, many changes are submitted to the Developer Group in advance and opinion is sought on the best ways to improve the API. This was highlighted most recently to me by Rob Mack who sent out an &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/gowalla-dev/browse_thread/thread/412852f04007ab4a#&quot;&gt;incredibly detailed post about changes&lt;/a&gt; they were going to make to the Check-In API. The changes were detailed along with a timeline of when they&#39;d go into effect (3 weeks in future) and a promise that anybody who wouldn&#39;t be able to meet the deadline would be able to get an extension if they emailed. This was followed up weekly with reminders of the impending changes. It&#39;s this kind of conversation and service that goes beyond what I had originally suggested and makes it such a pleasure to work with the API now. There have been numerous suggestions from the community that have been added to the API in recent months and responses to bugs or questions are incredibly fast.  Whilst versioning hasn&#39;t come into effect, it hasn&#39;t really needed to as any changes have been non-destructive or have had a sensible transition period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also be worth setting up a dedicated Twitter account for API changes as Foursquare has done with @foursquareapi - this would allow you to make quick posts to the community about any changes or downtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst posts on the Developer Board have been greatly improved, I still believe that having a Twitter account for broadcasts about downtime or any major changes would be a good idea. I currently subscribe to the full emails of the board and so I can get an email whenever anybody posts something new - sometimes these are API developers asking basic questions yet sometimes they are important posts by the Gowalla devs that could easily get lost in the noise (especially if you have digests on). By having a feed that just posted notices from the Gowalla developers, visibility of changes would be greatly improved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Cheating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote a section about cheaters purely because the option to check-in was not available in the API despite the fact it could be done easily using a JavaScript hack on the mobile site. The main reason for not having it in the API was that it would increase the ease for cheaters to make false check-ins just to collect stamps and items. Whilst the API was eventually updated to allow check-ins, the number of people cheating the system is still very high.  A lot of trips are completed by people that haven&#39;t been to the spots and increases in check-in radius (which was a sliding scale depending on spot size and is now 5km regardless) have only exacerbated the problem. A lot of Gowalla players report these users to Gowalla via GetSatisfaction or email but there isn&#39;t any visibility on action taken. There have, however, been instances where users have been suspended for checking-in too fast, oftentimes incorrectly just on the basis of community feedback.  In my letter last year, I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to cheating, it should be fairly simple to ascertain if somebody is checking-in illegally as you can measure the time and distance between two spots and see if the speed is over a certain threshold (e.g. if you have checked-in at Austin and London within 2 minutes then there is obviously a problem). An automated system could monitor such things and then suspend an account giving it limited permissions (e.g. no item trading) until a Gowalla developer (or STE member) has a chance to review the account and unlock or ban the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is possible as I decided to build my own system to do exactly this detection in order to stop the vigilante justice that had been seen.  However, many of the cheating accounts are private and are therefore unaccessible through the API which means Gowalla needs to tackle this problem themselves. I still believe that an automated system could work and involving the STE members would allow for a certain level of visibility on solving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are particularly troubling at the moment due to the launch of Gowalla Rewards, the ability to pick up items at certain locations which have some form of real world reward attached to them. This issue has been solved slightly by &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/items/tips/&quot;&gt;a policy Gowalla put in place&lt;/a&gt; which basically limits how many items you receive based on the number of check-ins you make - whilst a good system, it did essentially pitch those players who like items against those that like the stamps and trips (again read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/03/27/gamification-social-validation-gowalla-and-moving-on-from-wallabee-what-i-learned-at-sxsw/&quot;&gt;post on gamification&lt;/a&gt; for more details on this) and it wasn&#39;t relayed to the community very well at all.  There is still a lot of work to be done in this area in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Publicising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of other items I suggested was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a directory of applications that use the API (such as Foursquare has)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is something that hasn&#39;t happened yet but there have been some very small moves to publicise things that have been made with the Gowalla API.  On the post announcing OAuth integration, a couple of projects that used the API were mentioned and on the official Gowalla twitter feed, a couple of web apps have been mentioned (they both did the same thing about 4 months apart, but still).  However, making brief reference to 4 apps over the course of a year doesn&#39;t really promote all of the cool things that people are making. It also doesn&#39;t encourage other developers to get involved as, without promotion by Gowalla, the API feels a little like an afterthought which is a shame given the huge amount of improvement that has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A page highlighting some of the applications made using the API would enable new developers to see a benefit to writing apps for the service - it also enables developers to get their app across to the core audience (as most apps developed are going to be targeting users already on the Gowalla service). I&#39;m hopeful that the Gowalla twitter account will be posting out a few more of the great 3rd party apps that people have made over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the final criticisms I had was in the documentation of the API as it was particularly sparse.  Most of the comments on the Developer Boards were about errors being returned that weren&#39;t documented anywhere or about nuances in the API calls (e.g. why can&#39;t I check-in at the same place twice within an hour?) - However, the documentation has improved dramatically over the last few months with the Gowalla team listening to feedback from developers and patching up the docs or adding new pages as requested. A particularly difficult area was the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://hub.gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;PubSubHubbub&lt;/a&gt; feature (which should really be publicised more - it&#39;s amazing) yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/api/docs/pshb&quot;&gt;documentation was put up within a few days&lt;/a&gt; of a request on the boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Gowalla API has improved dramatically in the past year. With a solid foundation and regular updates from developers, there is now very little risk to basing an app on the API as opposed to last year when maintenance was taking longer than development.  There are still a few areas which could use improvement, particularly around publicising of 3rd party endeavours and communicating better around misdemeanours, but on the whole I can wholeheartedly recommend the API to any developer interested in location based services. There have been a lot of new API calls created and I get the feeling that there is some very exciting stuff around the corner. I would also recommend looking into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hub.gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;PubSubHubbub&lt;/a&gt; functionality as this puts Gowalla way ahead of its competitors by providing real-time notification of check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#39;d like to thank all the developers at Gowalla who have put so much time and effort into improving the API, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/therealadam&quot;&gt;Adam Keys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/andrewdupont&quot;&gt;Andrew Dupont&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/robmack&quot;&gt;Rob Mack&lt;/a&gt; who have been incredibly responsive on the Developer Boards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/&quot;&gt;Font Finder&lt;/a&gt;, one of my first Firefox Extensions.  The purpose of Font Finder was to display information about the selected font within your browser including information like size, line-height, color, etc. It also went further by not only showing you the font-family stack, but also determining which one was actively being rendered on your machine (as the font you see might be different to other users depending on your installed fonts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy to announce that as of today, Font Finder is now available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/browser-extensions/font-finder.safariextz&quot;&gt;Safari 5 Extension&lt;/a&gt;.  It has also been updated to be fully compatible with &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/font-finder/&quot;&gt;Firefox 4&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;m not planning on building it for any other browsers (e.g. IE9, Chrome) but if you have any suggestions for improvements to either version, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the first step in porting Font Finder to Safari 5 and I will shortly be releasing an update which makes full use of the Safari UI rather than containing everything within an alert box - I will also be adding a lot more information, particularly around CSS 3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Portal 2 on the new iMac (10.6.6)</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/04/portal-2-on-the-new-imac-10-6-6/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/04/portal-2-on-the-new-imac-10-6-6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I purchased one of the brand new iMacs that were released yesterday. One of the first things I installed was Steam and Portal 2 (as I&#39;m looking forward to playing co-operatively with a friend on Windows) but I was surprised when trying to play that it required OS X 10.6.7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-04-at-20.24.23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Portal 2 requires Mac OS 10.6.7&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-04 at 20.24.23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is surprising because 10.6.7 has been around for a little while now so why wasn&#39;t it on the new iMacs by default.  After trying a system update, I found that there was no update for the 10.6.6 iMacs and other people had tried the Combo Update downloadable from Apple to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading all of Portal 2, I decided not to give up easily and see if there was a way around it. Developers are generally lazy and so they are probably just checking for the string 10.6.6 in the system version.  As this version of 10.6.6 has all of the drivers for the new graphics card required for Portal 2, I thought there would probably be no harm in changing that system version to 10.6.7 to get past the Steam requirements. Turns out I was right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your copy of Portal 2 running on your new iMac, navigate to &lt;code&gt;/System/Library/CoreServices/&lt;/code&gt; - now copy the file &lt;code&gt;SystemVersion.plist&lt;/code&gt; to your desktop and open it for editing. Change the references to 10.6.6 to 10.6.7 and save. Now you&#39;ll want to delete the existing version and then copy your new file in it&#39;s place - you will need admin rights to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that&#39;s done, fire up Portal 2 - you may get the &quot;System requirements failed&quot; message but if you press &quot;Continue anyway&quot; then Portal 2 will load and be perfectly playable (at 1080p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go forth and continue testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; when a 10.6.7 fix does come available for the new iMac, you should probably edit the &lt;code&gt;SystemVersion.plist&lt;/code&gt; file and change the references back to 10.6.6 just to make sure nothing bad happens...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[20/05/11] Update:&lt;/strong&gt; OS X 10.6.7 is now available through System Update for the new iMacs - make sure you reverse the process above before updating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Worldictionary for iOS</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/01/review-worldictionary-for-ios/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/05/01/review-worldictionary-for-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/worldictionary-instant-translator/id429372600?mt=8&quot;&gt;Worldictionary&lt;/a&gt; is a translation app for iPhone that allows you to use the built-in camera to detect and translate words on the go.  The only language I understand other than English and the various programming languages I&#39;ve picked up is Latin, so an app to help me understand various signs and documents in foreign countries is definitely useful for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0414.png&quot; alt=&quot;Translating from English to French&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0414.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you launch the app, the camera is activated and you can instantly begin translating.  All you need to do is line up the magnifying glass with the word you want to translate and it will automatically appear at the top of the app.  The word it thinks it detects is displayed on top with the translation underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0411.png&quot; alt=&quot;Translation mistakes&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0411.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, the camera doesn&#39;t always detect words cleanly (more examples can be seen from the history panel in the bottom right corner) but it is very fast at detection so these issues don&#39;t interfere too much.  The app isn&#39;t designed to work with handwritten fonts but should work with anything in a regular font.  The example document I&#39;m using is a polling card for the upcoming election referendum here in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0416.png&quot; alt=&quot;Language selection&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0416.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the language, tap the bar at the bottom of the app which brings up a scrollable view listing an impressive number of languages to convert to and from.  These are all available by default so there is no in-app purchase for language packs as per some other translation apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0417.png&quot; alt=&quot;Translating from English to German&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0417.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a new language is chosen, you can start translating instantly.  I was struck by how fast detection and subsequent translation was and I experienced no problems with the app such as crashing or memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0418.png&quot; alt=&quot;Translation results&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0418.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tap the translated words or tap any previous translations listed on the right hand side of the app to go through to a more thorough translation detailing example usage, structure, synonyms, and definitions from the web (including services such as wikipedia and online dictionaries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the translation is good and the app does what it says, I did encounter 2 problems which may stumbling points depending on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the app only detects single words, not sentences or paragraphs both in camera mode and the manual input mode.  This might be fine for the odd word lookup but isn&#39;t terribly useful for something more involved such as a menu or road sign.  Also, without understanding sentences, words in some languages may not make sense (as many languages have words with different meanings depending on the surrounding words).  Whilst understanding full sentences is still difficult for translation algorithms, I do think the app would work better if it could at least do the per-word translation on an entire sentence so you don&#39;t have to slowly input each word individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/05/IMG_0424.png&quot; alt=&quot;No translation without network access&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0424.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is more important from my perspective but is also something that is unlikely to be fixed; you need to have internet access in order to perform translations. This is because the translation engine being used is Google Translate and therefore doesn&#39;t have offline access.  The reason this causes problems is that many people travel abroad where data roaming charges are still completely excessive (I was charged £6 per MB whilst I was in the US recently) and therefore switch their data roaming off.  The benefit of a translation app is that you can use it anywhere when you need it (e.g. translating a menu at a restaurant) and you may not have WiFi available - turning on the data roaming for translation could become an expensive habit, particularly if you haven&#39;t turned off other apps or push notifications before making the switch.  Whilst the API calls the app makes should be fairly small, I&#39;d be more worried about forgetting to turn off data roaming after I&#39;d used the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst these problems are present in other apps, there are some which manage to solve both of these such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8&quot;&gt;Word Lens&lt;/a&gt; which gained a lot of publicity when it first launched due to the clever way in which it uses the camera not only to translate, but also to place the translated words back into the original camera image.  It might be a more expense app with translation packs at £5.99 each, but it works offline and can translate whole sentences (in a very cool way).  Unfortunately, Word Lens only works with English and Spanish translations so is not terribly useful if you are going to France or Germany for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worldictionary is a clever app with its word recognition and fast translations (depending on network speed) but its lack of sentence recognition and reliance on internet connectivity lets it down.  If you can look past these issues, then I can recommend it as a good translation tool for those times when you need a rough translation or have a need for multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/worldictionary-instant-translator/id429372600?mt=8&quot;&gt;Worldictionary&lt;/a&gt; is priced at £2.99/$4.99 as is available in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on an iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.2.  If you have an app for iOS that you would like me to review, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iTunes TV Artwork Script</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/04/13/itunes-tv-artwork-script/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/04/13/itunes-tv-artwork-script/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a large amount of TV shows stored in iTunes but not all of them were purchased there, particularly as you can buy a Blu-Ray of many TV shows for a fraction of the price of a Standard Definition download. The only issue I&#39;ve had is that I lacked artwork for each of these shows. In the past, I&#39;d just screenshot the 200px or so image that showed up in the iTunes store and use that, but since getting an Apple TV (which displays the artwork at a much larger size) I decided I needed a better solution. After a weekend of sorting out my iTunes library, I decided to take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html&quot;&gt;iTunes Search API&lt;/a&gt; and see if I couldn&#39;t find a way of getting that artwork. They provide a 100x100px thumbnail as part of the API response, but fortunately (with some URL experimentation) I found a way to get the full 600x600px artwork.   
You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-tv-artwork/&quot;&gt;find the working version on my projects page&lt;/a&gt; but I thought I&#39;d share the code briefly below so you can see how it&#39;s done and adjust it for any other media available on iTunes (e.g. movies, music, apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;show&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/wa/wsSearch?term=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;urlencode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;entity=tvSeason&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;json_decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file_get_contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;url&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str_replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;100x100&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;600x600&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;artworkUrl100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;title&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it makes a fairly standard API call to the US iTunes store (as that has far more content than any of the others) which returns a lot of information about the particular entity (in this case a TV series).  However, the artwork URL provided is only good for a 100x100px image so I us  a basic &lt;code&gt;str_replace&lt;/code&gt; to change that to 600x600 (the only other size I&#39;ve found that works is 200x200).  Once that&#39;s done, I grab the title and stick it all in an array to loop through later - simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this script will be of some use to you - it&#39;s certainly made my library look a lot nicer when browsing on an iPad or an Apple TV!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gamification, Social Validation, Gowalla, and moving on from Wallabee - What I learned at SXSW</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, I’ve been a huge fan of maps and the concept of location. I used to spend hours drawing maps of the neighborhood where I lived and reading books and magazines about different countries and places around the world. Much later, I became a web developer and would spend a lot of time playing with the Google Maps APIs and creating mashups with the FireEagle service.  When the iPhone came out, I was hooked; not only for the simplistic UI (I could write an entire blog on how less is more with UI) but by the fact that your location was always in the palm of your hand.  Once the iPhone SDK came out, I switched careers purely because location-based apps were the stuff of my dreams and that’s what I wanted to spend my time on.   
Earlier this month, I headed to Austin for my first experience of SXSW.  Whilst many people (myself included) went for the talks and networking opportunities, I was mainly interested in meeting the people behind Gowalla, a location-based service I’ve spent a lot of time with over the past 3 years.  In Austin, I was staying with a group of friends who had come not for SXSW, but to collect the rare items and pins that would be available through Gowalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this blog post is to explain what I’ve learned about the future of location-based services both from talking to Gowalla employees, and watching how people play Gowalla in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gamification and Social Validation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key buzzwords of SXSW 2011 was “gamification” which is loosely defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of game play mechanics for non-game applications, particularly consumer-oriented web and mobile sites, in order to encourage people to adopt the applications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that apps add “tweet this” and “facebook that” buttons in order to tick the box for social media, it seems that the future is based around the idea of adding a game layer purely because other apps have one.  These mechanics tend to be of the badge variety which works by giving the user digital badges for reaching certain goals.  Some go further by giving you physical things (e.g. stickers) rather than digital items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to gamification, there is also the proliferation of the “check in” model of thinking.  This is the idea that you can now check in to anything be it a location (Gowalla, Foursquare), TV shows (Miso, Glue), Books (GoodReads), or just about anything else you can think of.  When the models are combined with social networks like Twitter of Facebook, it seems that most applications are generally designed to do 2 things; either tell people what you are doing or show-off to other people about how good you are at a digital task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the best talk at SXSW was by&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jw&quot;&gt; Josh Williams&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla&lt;/a&gt;, in which he discussed the future of location-based services in a talk entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/firewheel/where-are-we-going-sxsw-2011&quot;&gt;Where are we going&lt;/a&gt;”.  The candid presentation talked a lot about where services had gone wrong but was also self-admittedly contradictory (especially when you look at the Gowalla service overall which I’ll come onto later).  However, he had one key slide which I think resonated with everybody in the room:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social validation is the primary driver for activity on today’s web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a profound idea that suggests the reason that people play with game layers, send tweets, check in on apps, and use social networks and services is purely based on egotism; we do things not because we want to, but because we want to be accepted by society. This is not a new idea, but it is one that I think a lot of people have been blind to for a long time.  With one sentence, Williams had made me uninstall a number of apps on my phone and take a fundamental look at the projects I was working on and the people I was interacting with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key quote from the talk was:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game mechanics are subservient to the usefulness of a service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst this one didn’t hit me with as much impact as the piece on social validation, it’s something I’ve not been able to stop thinking about over the past few weeks. Social validation is the main reason people use a game mechanic but what is the driver for playing a regular game, watching TV, or reading a book? After thinking on it, I’ve concluded that the driver for offline tasks tends to be story, whilst online we tend to want to  share our story.  By way of example, I might watch Mad Men as I enjoy the plot, but I’ll tweet about it because I want social validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This describes the correlation between offline and social networking well enough, but what about game mechanics? These were created in order to incentivise a story action but tend more often to promote the idea of social validation.  An interesting game mechanic to look at would be something like Xbox Achievements or PS3 trophies. These were designed to extend the life of a game by adding extra challenges that weren’t part of the main storyline yet have now evolved into an exercise in social validation.  People will now play games not because they are interested in the game itself but because they want a higher gamerscore. I’ve seen (and been a part of) this idea myself and it’s only when I think about it that I realise that the best games I’ve played are generally the ones which don’t have achievements. Games like Zelda and Final Fantasy are good because of the story and core mechanic, not because they improve my gamerscore.  I’m not saying that all achievements are bad, but I do feel that a game like Assassins Creed II is detracted from when players are performing tasks such as collecting 100 feathers for the sole reason of improving their gamerscore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst console games can have both this social validation aspect and a good storyline, a worrying trend with most new game mechanics and online games is that they don’t have the story portion at all.  For instance, what is the point of Farmville?  There is no ending, there is storyline, it is simply a game based around social validation.  So it is for services like PackRat (made by the same people as Gowalla) in which you can collect items simply for the purpose of showing other people.  Both these games (and others) have an element of a game currency (for purchases of items in the game world) which can be topped up with real money.  You therefore end up actually paying real money to purchase items in a digital world for the sole purpose of showing them off to other people.  I eventually stopped playing PackRat when I came to the realisation that I was spending money and time (sometimes jumping up when new items came out so I could be the first to get one) on a service which actually had no benefit.  I maintain that the reason for this is that there is no ending - users might spend time collecting all the Pokémon on a Nintendo DS as they know there is an ending, but with Farmville, PackRat, et al., the whole thing is continual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gowalla: A game of two halves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what of location-based services?  Gowalla has a difficult task ahead of it currently as it is walking a line of two different concepts; the idea of exploring the world and the idea of collecting items.  I believe these can be defined as story and social validation respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gowalla have used variations of “explore the world” since they first started and it is one of the key things that drew me to them.  With their beautiful artwork, it was easy to imagine that your travels were like those in the past where travelers would place a sticker on their suitcase from each place they visited.  The concept of a digital passport imitating the real world was exciting and they have done a great job of extending this with featured spots and trips.  More recently, highlights and notes have allowed users to show where there favorite places are both publicly and privately and encourage other people to visit those locations.  One of the most interesting pieces they are working on is in telling the “story” of your travels.  This has begun with them joining your flights together and showing the distance (and connecting flights if applicable) when you check-in at 2 or more airports in a row.  They used this feature to award a special pin for those that had travelled to SXSW when they landed back at their originating airport (so I got mine at Heathrow after travelling back from Austin airport).  Williams has been mentioning for a long time that these flight updates are “just the beginning” and I can envisage a future in which they can build up a digital holiday keepsake for you (complete with photos, highlights, check-ins, and tweets) by using this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the other side of Gowalla is one based on a game layer.  Items have long been a sore point to many users (including myself for a time) as they were one of the key features that differentiated Gowalla from other location based services (such as Foursquare).  As most new users were coming from PackRat, it is easy to see why items were such a key part to many peoples experience.  However, like the never-ending gamification I described earlier, there is no ending for items.  Once you have them all, you don’t get anything as a new one might be released next week.  Therefore there is no end and no purpose to collecting them other than to show off to other people for social validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gowalla have been slowly trying to lessen the importance of items within the game in order to focus on story, but as they have done so the community has been more and more vocal about the changes.  One of the changes was to make it so that checking in to more than 5 places within an hour would trigger a switch preventing you from receiving items for the next 24 hours.  This was at odds with the “collect them all” aspect of items which require checking in all over the place in order to get them but was done in the interest of making people check-in where they are right now rather than checking-in everywhere within 5km (the current distance you are allowed to check-in from your actual location) just to get items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was privy to many embarrasing moments at SXSW where the Gowalla team were subjected to people complaining about items, check-ins, and the other aspects that I’m sure Gowalla don’t really care about (as they don’t build on the story mechanic).  I saw some of the most childish outbursts I’ve ever seen in my life over something as simple as a digital item and it really put me off items as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Gowalla need to cut items lose in order to really grow as a service.  Judging by the complaints on their GetSatisfaction pages, I’d say that the vast majority of complaints are about the game mechanic rather than the overall service and its story elements.  If they were to cut off the game mechanic, Gowalla would lose a lot of users, but they’d be able to focus on the key part of the service; “seeing the world”.  This in turn would build a better product and allow them to regain users who share their vision rather than trying to maintain the careful balance they have at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current belief is that items are slowly being fashioned into rewards, a feature that was launched at SXSW.  With rewards, some of the digital items you find are actually usable as promotional offers (so you might get a “free taco” item which allows you get a free taco when you check-in at certain locations).  If they removed the non-reward items, they could have a social layer which has a purpose and isn’t tied so intrinsically with the limitations of exploration.  By that, I mean that people would be encouraged to check-in only where they are currently, and by doing so they may receive one of these promotional rewards.  Once a reward is used, it should then be archived as it then serves as a history of the promotions you’ve earned (which are a story in themselves).  By doing this, you no longer have a part of the service which encourages multiple check-ins for items which have no value beyond social validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this is there current plan, but it seems a sensible way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wallabee: A project based on Gowalla items&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with my projects, you’ll know of a service I created called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/&quot;&gt;Wallabee&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s a website (and set of apps) that build on the Gowalla API and basically dishes out a lot of information about items in particular.  I originally created it as I wanted an easy way of finding out which types of spots items appeared at.  Items were a fun feature at the start of Gowalla and I would travel to whole new places just to pick up an item - I used to think I was doing this because I wanted items but I eventually realised that I was enjoying having a reason to go to new places and “see the world”. Once I made the site public, it gathered a large following and has grown into various things since.  There are apps, item hunters, tools to show Flickr photos at different spots, and a new guide which introduces players to key Gowalla concepts (as Gowalla itself has no tutorial).  However, the most popular things every time have been things to do with items (which is confirmed by a new feature I built recently called the Item Directory which shows people where every item can be found in real time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After SXSW and thinking on both the attitudes of people I’d seen and the talks I’d heard, as well as mulling over everything I’ve said above with regards to social validation, gamification, and the future of Gowalla, I decided that I just didn’t want to do this anymore.  I’ve been working on Wallabee in its various incarnations for two and a half years and it wasn’t until I took a step back that I realised everything I was doing was based on items.  I’m not interested in Gowalla items. I haven’t even been actively trying  to collect them myself for the past year (yet I seem to have got them all just because of my slow check-in rate) so why am I building free apps based around them? I realised that I was doing it not because I wanted to, but because it was what most of the followers I’d gained (by starting with item-based tools) were asking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve therefore decided to stop working on Wallabee and instead focus on building location-based apps that extend the story aspects of travel rather than the gamification aspects.  If you’re a Wallabee user, then you’ll want to&lt;a href=&quot;http://wallab.ee/pouch/2011/03/27/moving-on-from-wallabee/&quot;&gt; read my post on the Wallabee site about how this affects you&lt;/a&gt;, but basically I’m handing the site over to another developer who is interested in the gamification layer and in building upon the brand I’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still be using the Gowalla API and the Gowalla service as I think it shows great potential and is a genuinely exciting location-based service.  I’ll be doing this under my own name rather than the Wallabee brand, however, and the apps will mostly be of a paid nature.  This begins soon with a completely new app which I’ll be releasing shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;To the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post ended up being about five times longer than I intended but I hope it gives you an insight into what I think about location-based services moving forward as well as some of the social issues around game mechanics.  To finish, I’d like to take one more quote from Josh Williams talk at SXSW:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay true to your vision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost track of my vision when I started developing tools that I wasn’t using myself.  I’m looking forward to returning to my vision by creating new apps that will help people explore the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile OS Updates: Android vs iOS</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/02/11/mobile-os-updates-android-vs-ios/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/02/11/mobile-os-updates-android-vs-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months, I&#39;ve been using two competing phones day-today; a Nexus S (Android) and an iPhone 4 (iOS).  Whilst there are many differences and similarities, one of the things I want to talk about today is the different ways in which they deal with updates to the core operating system.  System updates are a crucial part of the mobile experience - sometimes they offer major new features but they are usually minor updates to deal with bug fixes.  So how do Apple and Google deliver their system updates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Android&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android platform updates itself via an &quot;over-the-air&quot; system which appears to rely on individual carriers to push out system updates.  Due to the large number of different devices, certain updates will only appear for certain phones and this fragments further by region and carrier.  For example, Android 2.3.3 came out 2 days ago and only runs on the Nexus S at present - whilst a number of customers in the US have received the update, my Nexus S is still refusing to detect an update from 2.3.2 leaving me to conclude that it is waiting for my carrier to push it out.  However, when an update does appear, the process is very slick.  A notification appears to let you know you have an update including details of what this adds and the size (which for minor updates tends to be a couple of MB).  One tap starts the download process and, once complete, the phone reboots and you&#39;re up and running.  At no point do you need to plug into a computer or even connect to a wireless network. It&#39;s very impressive.  However, the lack of cohesive strategy on when updates will appear and on what devices they will work on causes the whole process to be a bit of a disappointment, especially when you&#39;re waiting on a major bug fix or new feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iOS update system is very different.  Each update requires you to plug your iPhone into iTunes where an update will then download and sync to the phone.  Each update includes the entire OS, rather than an incremental update, so is typically around 450MB (depending on device).  This takes a long time to download but then takes about the same time again to install onto the device.  The advantage to this process is that if something goes wrong you can restore from a backup immediately (whereas on an Android phone in the wild you&#39;d be stuck without a phone).  Also, when an update is available, it is generally available globally within 2 hours of release and there is a button you can press to check for updates manually.  Apple also post a direct download link on their support boards so it is generally fairly easy to get an update regardless of your location or carrier.  However, the lack of an over-the-air facility and the massive downloads are very tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at the two download mechanisms, one would expect that Android users would update their phones more frequently than iOS users, particularly as the update is delivered directly to the device.  However, the lack of support for devices and the requirement for carriers to approve updates means that only 0.8% of all Android users are currently running OS 2.3, with 57.6% on 2.2, 31.4% on 2.1, and the rest on pre 2.* software.  It is difficult to contrast fairly with iOS as Apple don&#39;t release breakdown usage stats, but by looking at the usage figures the major apps are publishing you can get an idea.  The number of users running iOS 4.* is around 90% with over 50% on the latest build of iOS 4.2 - there are only 10% running the previous generation family of 3.x and these are most likely users on the original iPhone and iPod Touches that aren&#39;t able to upgrade to iOS 4.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android Figures accurate as of Feb 2nd, 2011 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Usage_share&quot;&gt;from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread): 0.8%&lt;br&gt;
Android 2.2 (Froyo): 57.6%&lt;br&gt;
Android 2.0/2.1 (Eclair): 31.4%&lt;br&gt;
Android 1.6 (Donut): 6.3%&lt;br&gt;
Android 1.5 (Cupcake): 3.9%&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS Figures based on &quot;Bump&quot; application as of Jan 14th, 2011 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/What-proportion-of-all-iPhone-owners-use-iOS4-*-today&quot;&gt;from Quora&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.2.1: 52.89 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.2: 0.09 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.1: 27.50 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.0.2: 3.36 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.0.1: 2.95 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 4.0: 2.94 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.2.2: 0.49 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.2.1: 0.07 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.2: 0.10 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.1.3: 6.43 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.1.2: 2.52 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.1.1: 0.10 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.1: 0.21 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.0.1: 0.10 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 3.0: 0.22 %&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
iOS 2.2.1: 0.02 %&lt;br&gt;
iOS 2.2: 0.00 %
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still keenly waiting for my update to Android 2.2.3 as it adds, amongst other things, a new feature which enables the NFC chip in the Nexus S to write to tags as well as read from them (something that should have been there from the start in my opinion).  However, until my carrier pushes it out, I have to wait whilst other developers on US carriers get a head start.  This would be fine for the average user normally, but I fail to understand why Google aren&#39;t hosting a manual update?  An over-the-air update is convenient, but if there is a major bug fix then you should be able to download the update manually and do a tethered sync at the same time that Google pushes the update live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iOS system seems more archaic in that the updates are massive and you need to manually update, but the way in which Apple publicise the updates seems to ensure that users are updating.  Whilst the statistics above aren&#39;t wholly reliable, it shows a trend that users are aware of iOS updates and willing to plug in and upgrade. From my own anecdotal evidence, I&#39;ve seen similar high numbers of upgrade take-up with many non-technical people in my family running the latest version of iOS without any help to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that Apple has done this better is that they a) publicise a new release (going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://android.com/&quot;&gt;android.com&lt;/a&gt; shows nothing about 2.3.3 aside from a blog post on the developer board directing you to download the SDK) and b) have a &quot;check for updates&quot; button that you can click when you hear that an update is available.  The Nexus S has a &quot;System Updates&quot; section within &quot;Settings&quot; but this only shows updates you&#39;ve already been told about rather than forcing an update check.  From searching around the internet this afternoon looking for the update, I found a number of posts extolling the virtues of dialling &lt;strong&gt;*#*#2432546#*#*&lt;/strong&gt; (which is *#*#checkin#*#*) which forces the device to do a checkin with your carrier and should push any updates that are waiting to you.  This is not an update system for the casual user!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Apple have unified their product line so that a new iOS update is immediately able to run on the iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone, and now the Apple TV.  There are certain devices which are excluded (e.g. the original iPhone and original iPod Touch) but these are well highlighted.  With Android, I have no idea which phones can or can&#39;t update and if there are technical limitations for this (as with the iOS updates) or simply the carriers not being bothered.  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://androidspin.com/2011/01/12/breaking-t-mobile-internals-confirm-samsung-is-holding-the-android-world-hostage/&quot;&gt;some reports&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that the carriers are loathe to push out functional updates as they detract away from new products they are selling...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think Apple needs to take some of the improvements in updating that Android has made such as pushing out incremental updates rather than forcing you to redownload the OS, and allowing you to update the OS without connecting to iTunes (even if this is only over Wi-Fi).  However, the major problem with Android is that it is stitched up with mobile carriers, something the iPhone broke away from.  When this extends to critical bug fixes, then it is the end user that suffers.  Apple needs to take some cues from Android in terms of implementation, but Google needs to take back more &quot;openness&quot; from the carriers if they are to provide a sufficient update system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: WorldCard Mobile for Android and iPhone</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/23/review-worldcard-mobile-for-android/</guid>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/product.asp?sn=242&quot;&gt;WorldCard Mobile&lt;/a&gt; is one of many applications that allows you to scan in a business card and have the details automatically loaded into your contacts.  I haven&#39;t used one of these kinds of applications in a long time and so I jumped at the chance to test one when a review copy was sent to me.   
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/menu-300x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;WorldCard Mobile Menu Screen&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-485&quot; /&gt;

The opening screen is fairly straightforward with the option to start scanning either by taking a picture with the camera or using a photo from your library.  There is also an &quot;Exit&quot; button which I disagree with from a UI point of view as that is the point of the physical home button surely?  I&#39;m probably being overly harsh as that kind of thing is prohibited by Apple and so I don&#39;t come across it much when looking at iOS apps, but I generally frown upon any duplication of standard controls with your own versions (for example, websites that have &quot;back&quot; buttons - that&#39;s what the standard browser &quot;back&quot; button is for!)

Anyway, I had a business card for one of my friends who works in Australia so I decided to give that a try by using the Camera feature.  This loads up a standard camera control and allows you to take your photo.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/card-capture-300x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;WorldCard Mobile - Capture&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-486&quot; /&gt;

Once captured, you can zoom into the image, rotate it, and choose the correct language from a choice of seven; English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch.  Pressing the &quot;Recognize&quot; button will then fire up the OCR system that ran in under 1 second on my Nexus S.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/capture-300x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;WorldCard Mobile - Captured Information&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-487&quot; /&gt;

As you can see, the captured data is incredibly accurate.  The only problem was with the word &quot;Lisa&quot; which came out as &quot;Usa&quot; but that is partially due to the closeness of the letters on the business card and me not taking a picture close enough.  I was particularly impressed with the intelligent way in which it parsed the data enabling it to set the fax numbers correctly as well as building the company name from the logo and footer and correctly picking out the job title.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/edit-300x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;WorldCard Mobile - Edit Contact&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-488&quot; /&gt;

Editing any information that wasn&#39;t correct is very easy with a standard editing dialogue.  I quickly fixed the name and saved before then pressing the export button.  This sends the contact information into your devices address book.  As I already had contact information for this person (pulled in automatically from FaceBook), it simply updated the existing record with the new work related information without any prompting.

Overall, I&#39;m incredibly impressed with this app and the very fast and accurate OCR software built into it.  If you are frequently given business cards, I would highly recommend it as a quick and efficient way of storing them.

WorldCard Mobile costs $5.99 and is available on the Android MarketPlace.  There are other versions available at a higher price for recognising Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text.  You can find more details at &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/&quot;&gt;http://worldcard.penpowerinc.com/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I was given a free copy of this application to review. I tested it on a Nexus S running Android 2.3.  If you have an app for iOS or Android that you would like me to review, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; WorldCard were kind enough to give me a review copy of their app for iPhone as well.  The interface is pretty much the same with very similar functionality although I did notice that the iPhone version allowed you to review your imported cards within the app (rather than just exporting them to the address book as on Android).  However, the recognition quality didn&#39;t seem to be as impressive as the Android version with several errors being made compared to the one basic error on the Android app.  I&#39;m not sure if this is something to do with the code or with the iPhone hardware (although the tap to focus made me think the iPhone would function better) but for now I&#39;ll be using my Nexus S to do any business card recognition.

      <title>Enabling any HTML5 Video to work over AirPlay</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/13/enabling-any-html5-video-to-work-over-airplay-e-g-vimeo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s taken a little while longer than I expected to but I&#39;ve managed to put together a script to make any HTML 5 video playable through Safari on the iPad.  With the advent of iOS 4.3, Apple are now allowing websites to add a special tag to their video markup in order to enable video streaming (as with the current 4.2 version you only get audio streaming).  However, with one simple JavaScript bookmarklet, you can now enable AirPlay video for any website.   
First of all, you&#39;ll need to save the following bookmark - the best way is to save the link below as a bookmark on your computer and then sync it to your iPad via iTunes or MobileMe: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:d=document,e=d.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);e.src=&#39;https://bendodson.com/bookmarklets/ios-airplay.js?&#39;+(new%20Date()*1);void(d.body.appendChild(e));&quot;&gt;HTML5 AirPlay Bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Alternatively, bookmark this page on your iPad and then copy the text below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;script&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://bendodson.com/bookmarklets/ios-airplay.js?&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now need to edit the bookmark you saved for this page and paste the code above into the URL (you&#39;ll probably want to rename it as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bookmark is saved, you just need to go to any HTML 5 video (such as cnn.com or tvcatchup.com) online and start playing it.  You&#39;ll notice if you look at the AirPlay window that you can only stream audio.  If you now load the bookmark, the video should disappear, and then come back with AirPlay now enabled for video.  This short video below will demonstrate the process a little better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/18730809?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work?  To get AirPlay to send a video stream in Safari, you need to add the attribute &lt;code&gt;x-webkit-airplay=&quot;allow&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; tag.  I assumed that by adding this to an existing video via JavaScript then it would automatically work.  However, Apple have been slightly clever and ignore any parameters you add via JavaScript.  So, I instead use JavaScript to add the new attribute before cloning the video, removing it from the DOM, and then re-adding it.  This re-addition to the DOM seems to trigger something in Safari which causes it to re-read the AirPlay attribute and allow you to stream the video.  Please note that this will only work with iOS 4.3 on the iPad with iOS 4.3 on the Apple TV.  If you try and stream to an Apple TV running older software, Safari will crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is currently in a very rough stage yet so far has been tested and works with vimeo.com as well as native HTML 5 video on websites such as apple.com - it doesn&#39;t work with any HTML 5 video wrapped in a custom skin (e.g. the BBC iPlayer) but who knows what will be possible in the future.  If you have any additions or improvements, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A few people have contacted me about embedded videos such as the one on this page. Unfortunately, with Vimeo at least, these don&#39;t work as they are packaged up in an iFrame rather than being native &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; content.  JavaScript isn&#39;t able to access the contents of an iFrame from a different domain due to the cross-domain security policy.  If videos are embedded natively, then they&#39;ll play fine, but for iFrame content you&#39;ll need to go to the original website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This workaround is still functioning in iOS 4.3 beta 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; And it is still working in iOS 4.3 beta 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; And finally, this works in the publicly available version of iOS 4.3 - enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve altered the article slightly as vimeo.com is now adding the AirPlay functionality automatically to their website (so I&#39;ve changed the examples given). I&#39;ve also added a copy-paste section of code as that may be easier for getting the bookmarklet onto your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve taken a look at using this on iOS 5.0 beta 1 but so far the AirPlay functionality isn&#39;t working well. This is more likely an issue with the beta (which is fairly buggy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; iOS 5 has changed the defaults for how AirPlay works. This means that all online video is now classed as AirPlay enabled (unless the content provider opts out) making this bookmark now redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iOS 4.3</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/12/ios-4-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/11/thoughts-on-the-verizon-iphone-4/&quot;&gt;predicted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, iOS 4.3 has now become available for developers with the hotspot functionality demoed on the Verizion iPhone 4 now available to all.  It works by replacing the previous &amp;quot;Internet Tethering&amp;quot; functionality with everything being included under one banner.  This means you can now tether your iPhone via Bluetooth, USB, or WiFI (along with 5 other devices).  The carrier support is exactly the same as for internet tethering so if you are already paying for that (or get it for free), then you will be able to use the new hotspot functionality free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/IMG_0161-333x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;iOS 4.3 Personal Hotspot&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-467&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#39;t demo the hotspot at the moment as I don&#39;t currently pay for tethering.  The reason for this is that my carrier (O2) charges an extra £7.50 per month for an extra 500MB to use for data tethering.  You can&#39;t use the data allowance you already have.  This is in stark contrast to Android in which you can use the device as a Wi-Fi hotspot with no charge at all - it just shares your existing connection.  I was rather hoping that Apple would move away from this money-grabbing opportunity for the carriers but it seems not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this change, there is also an update for AirPlay relating specifically to the Apple TV.  As I tweeted previously, you could enable AirPlay video streaming in 3rd party apps due to a private method on the MPMoviePlayerController class.  However, Apple have now made this public with an update for the AppleTV as well.  This means that 3rd party apps can now stream video to the AppleTV which is great news for apps such as MLB (which mean I can stream video from my iPad to my AppleTV - no more baseball games on the iPhone for me!).  Other changes are mainly cosmetic with a slight rearrangement of the settings panel and some new multi-touch gestures for the iPad.  Interestingly, Apple have responded to the controversy around the reassigning of the &quot;orientation lock&quot; button in iOS 4.2 on the iPad by now enabling you to choose whether you want it to act as a silent switch or an orientation lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these changes are things I&#39;d predicted but I&#39;m really glad to see Apple have implemented them.  Video streaming over AirPlay and Hotspot on the iPhone are two great new features.  Roll on iOS 5.0!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any specific questions about iOS 4.3, either get in touch via &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or chat to me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on the Verizon iPhone 4</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/11/thoughts-on-the-verizon-iphone-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verizon have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/iphone.jsp&quot;&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; that they&#39;ll be selling a CDMA version of the iPhone 4 from February 10th.  On the face of it, this news is only really exciting to US customers who don&#39;t like AT&amp;T isn&#39;t it? Well, yes and no.  As an iPhone developer, this news is of great importance to me as more iPhones being sold means more people who can buy apps.  That&#39;s a good thing!  However, for everyone else, the Verizon iPhone 4 has some new features that may make it into the current GSM models of the iPhone.  It also points to some interesting changes possibly coming to iOS to combat the increasing functionality that Android offers.   
The iPhone 4 that has been shown today is different to the existing iPhone 4 in two key ways; an antenna redesign and a new &quot;hotspot&quot; feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Antenna Redesign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/cdma-vs-gsm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;iPhone 4: CDMA vs GSM&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-456&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the photo I&#39;ve put together above, the current GSM version of the iPhone 4 is on the left whilst the new CDMA version is on the right.  You can see on the old version that there are gaps for the antenna in the bottom corners of the phone and at the top next to the headphone jack.  On the new version, however, there are a total of 4 antenna breaks with one in each corner.  Not only does it look nicer, but I&#39;m willing to bet it&#39;s been redesigned to fix the Antennagate problem that plaqued the iPhone 4 upon its release.  Now that a new case has been designed, it&#39;s not beyond reason to think that Apple might silently make any new iPhone 4s they are shipping use this new case design, especially if it improves performance.  Alternatively, I would expect the iPhone 5 to have the same basic design as the iPhone 4 but just have a speed boost internally (similar to the iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 3G) so this new design may be suitable for that.  Time will tell I suppose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hotspot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting news for most commentators is that the new iPhone 4 has a feature called Hotspot &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/11iphone.html&quot;&gt;&quot;allowing customers to use iPhone 4 to connect up to five Wi-Fi enabled devices&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is something that Android has been doing for a little while and a feature I use frequently on my Nexus S.  With the current iPhone 4, you can tether via USB or Bluetooth but you generally have to pay extra for the privilege (which is a little excessive considering you&#39;ve already paid for the data).  It hasn&#39;t been confirmed or denied by Apple, but I wonder if we might not see this functionality introduced worldwide by adding it to the next version of iOS.  I have long suspected that iOS would get an upgrade to 4.3 at some point in late January or February and so this would fit in well with the launch date of the new Verizon iPhone 4 (in that it could come bundled with iOS 4.3).  Complete conjecture for the time being but it&#39;s an interesting idea and shows that Apple is willing to go head to head with Android on features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-4-will-have-3g-mobile-hotspot/&quot;&gt;Engadget report&lt;/a&gt; that the Verizon iPhone that they got to play with after the announcement was running a bespoke build of iOS 4.2.5 and that the Hotspot functionality is built into iOS as &quot;Personal Hotspot&quot;.  I definitely think this is a contender for inclusion publicly in iOS 4.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/01/11/ios-4-3-to-bring-mobile-hotspots-to-gsm-iphones-pending-carrier-support/&quot;&gt;Mac Rumors&lt;/a&gt; is now reporting that iOS 4.3 will bring hotspot support to the GSM iPhone 4 but activating it will require carrier support (and potentially charges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; As I predicted, Apple have release iOS 4.3 to developers with the new hotspot functionality in place.  It replaces the existing internet tethering feature so still costs money on some carriers (alas).  For more information, read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2011/01/12/ios-4-3/&quot;&gt;full article on iOS 4.3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading through some of my old blog posts when I discovered an article that is still fairly popular about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/09/08/control-mac-mini-from-iphone-with-waking-sleeping-audio-video/&quot;&gt;controlling a mac mini via an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.  I had an old mac mini lying around and so installed it in my bedroom as a device which basically acted as an iTunes library and alarm clock.  Times have changed though and I no longer have a mac mini in my bedroom; I have an Apple TV.  With the recent news about iPhone alarm clocks failing to go off (again) and lots of hacking projects with AirPlay to try and stream more than just YouTube videos, I decided to work on something this evening I&#39;ve been thinking about for a little while; turning my Apple TV into an Alarm Clock.  The basic idea is that at a set time in the morning, the Apple TV will wake itself up automatically and start playing a set playlist from my shared iTunes library.  The first step would be to get audio playlists working, but the ultimate goal would be to have video alarms as well.  Thanks to a bit of AppleScript, I&#39;ve managed to cook up a basic app to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does one go about creating an AirPlay Alarm Clock?  First of all, you will need a mac that is turned on with a shared iTunes library of content. The &quot;turned on&quot; bit can be automated from System Settings i.e. your machine can be asleep but told to wake up 5 minutes before your alarm is due to go off if you want to save energy.  You will also need an AirPlay compatible device - this can be a set of speakers plugged into an Airport Express, one of the new AirPlay compatible iHome speaker systems, or an Apple TV.  Please note that video playback will obviously only work on the Apple TV although you will get the audio from the video if you select an audio-only device.  Once you&#39;ve got those, you&#39;ll need to make a small tweak to your OS X setup: if you go into System Preferences and then Universal Access, you&#39;ll need to enable access for assistive devices - this is so AppleScript can make keypresses on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, on to the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;AppleTVName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Bedroom Apple TV&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Alarm&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;shuffle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll explain all of that in a bit more detail shortly, but for those of you that want to get cracking, you can copy and paste that into the AppleScript Editor that comes free with every copy of OS X.  You&#39;ll want to tweak the first two lines so that the variables match the name of your device and your playlist.  Once that is done, you can save the script as an application.  To get the alarm to play automagically in the mornings, you can open up iCal and create a new event (it can be recurring if you want a daily alarm).  In the &quot;alarm&quot; section, there is a little known entry called &quot;run script&quot; which you can use to run an AppleScript at a specified time relative to the alarm.  If you choose the script you saved, then it will automatically run at the allotted time.  Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This script is currently set to shuffle your playlist so that you don&#39;t get the same song every morning.  However, if you want to playback video, you have to disable the shuffling as iTunes doesn&#39;t like playing shuffled video playlists over AirPlay for some reason.  To do that, you need to edit the 3rd line from the bottom in the AppleScript to say &quot;&lt;code&gt;set shuffle of playlist PlaylistName to 0&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a geeky sort of person, you&#39;ll probably want to know how all of that script works.  Here is a quick breakdown of each section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;AppleTVName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Bedroom Apple TV&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Alarm&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to setup some variables in order to make it as easy as possible to change later on.  The first is the name of your device (as listed in iTunes) and the second is the name of your chosen playlist.  The next two lines tell iTunes to activate (basically open it if it&#39;s closed, or bring it to the front if it&#39;s already open) and then a short delay to make sure everything has caught up.  You&#39;ll notice the line &quot;delay 0.2&quot; in quite a lot of places in this code.  It is there to delay all activity by 0.2 seconds and is required as AppleScript can sometimes run quicker than the buttons it&#39;s pressing - by adding the delays every so often, it ensures that you aren&#39;t trying to access windows or menus which haven&#39;t yet appeared.  If the script isn&#39;t working for some reason and you have an old machine, try increasing the delay timeouts first of all as these are usually the culprit.  The next couple of lines force iTunes to make the main window prominent (in case we have any sub-windows hanging around) and also to display the playlist we want to play prominently.  The first version of this script didn&#39;t have that and everything generally worked fine so long as the last screen you looked at on iTunes was a music page.  I left a TV show list open and found it no longer worked (caused an error with the button handling) so I&#39;ve added this section to ensure you are always on the correct page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;125&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;keystroke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section controls the little AirPlay button in the bottom right hand corner of iTunes.  You can usually target buttons with their names rather than their index position but the AirPlay button is a special case as it has a different name depending on which device you have selected.  I have 4 different AirPlay devices in my house so rather than writing a big if statement to check for each name and then press accordingly, I instead target the button by it&#39;s numerical index.  You can find out the index of UI elements by using the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;http://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/&quot;&gt;UI Browser&lt;/a&gt; tool - it&#39;s a little bit pricey but worth the money if you are planning on doing a lot of AppleScripting.  Once we&#39;ve told iTunes to click on the button, we use key code 125 (which means the down key) in conjunction with the command button to jump down the entire context list to the &quot;Multiple Speakers...&quot; option.  Originally, I wanted to read the list of devices, iterate through them, and then select the one we wanted but I had a lot of problems getting AppleScript to correctly read the context menu so went for this slightly more longwinded approach instead.  Once the &quot;Multiple Speakers...&quot; option is selected, we hit return to make it open the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Multiple Speakers&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;scroll&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;area&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is now specifically targeting the &quot;Multiple Speakers&quot; window which we just opened.  The activate command allows us to start interacting with it, and by using UI Browser, we find that button 2 is the maximum volume setting.  I decided to set this manually here (rather than using the existing volume) just in case I had it set really quiet (or muted) for any reason.  This ensures that the music will always come through at it&#39;s maximum volume.  The next section lets us select the table listing which shows each device that we are about to iterate through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rowcount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rowcount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;AppleTVName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;does not equal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;AppleTVName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a big fan of the DRY (don&#39;t repeat yourself) principle of coding so you may wonder why there are two loops here which are essentially the same.  The first goes through the list and turns the checkbox on for the device we want to play our alarm through.  The second goes through the same list again, but turns off any devices that aren&#39;t our chosen alarm device.  My first thought was to do one loop that went through and turned the checkbox on if the device was correct or off it wasn&#39;t.  The problem with that approach is that you can&#39;t turn off the Computer audio until you&#39;ve selected another device.  Therefore, you have to go through once to turn on the chosen device and then through again to turn the others (if they were enabled) off.  A little tedious but this is a bit hacky anyway!  I&#39;ve updated the delay in the first loop from 0.2 to 0.5 as I found that a 0.2 delay would occasionally not be enough time for an AirPlay speaker to be selected before the next loop comes in and turns of the Computer.  This led to an alert in the script (thus pausing everything not leading to playback) which is obviously not ideal in an alarm clock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Multiple Speakers&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for the sake of tidiness, this tell will close the &quot;Multiple Speakers&quot; window we opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;shuffle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PlaylistName&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final section tells iTunes to shuffle our playlist (remember to turn the shuffle off &amp;mdash; set shuffle of playlist PlaylistName to 0 &amp;mdash; if you are going to send video via AirPlay) and then play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! A small piece of AppleScript to enable audio and video alarms over AirPlay.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update [11th Jan 2011]:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve amended two sections of the code.  Firstly, I&#39;ve added a line near the top which ensures that the playlist you want to play is selected and displayed as the main view.  Previous versions worked perfectly when I tested them as I was in the &quot;Music&quot; section of iTunes but if you are in a video section (e.g. left on a TV show page) then there would be an error as it couldn&#39;t find the AirPlay button (as the index was different).  The second change is a delay in the looping section has been increased from 0.2 to 0.5 as occasionally it took slightly longer than 0.2 seconds to select an AirPlay speaker. This caused a problem as the script would alert causing everything to pause.  Both lines have been amended in the code at the top of the page and in the analysis afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update [25th Oct 2011]:&lt;/strong&gt; The button codes have changed in iTunes 10.4 and 10.5 so I&#39;ve updated the above script so it will continue to work. The key part was changing &lt;code&gt;click button 8 of window &quot;iTunes&quot; of application process&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;click button 10 of window &quot;iTunes&quot; of application process&lt;/code&gt;. Thanks to Thomas Engbjerg for letting me know it was broken!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update [25th Jan 2012]:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve added this code to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/Apple-TV-Alarm-Clock&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for easier managing. If something should break in the future (looking at you iTunes 10.6) then a fix will be put up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update [15th Mar 2012]:&lt;/strong&gt; iTunes 10.6 did break as expected - needed to add a &lt;code&gt;delay 0.2&lt;/code&gt; before the call to speak with the &lt;code&gt;&quot;Multiple Speakers&quot;&lt;/code&gt; window due to some newly introduced lag. Updated here and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendodson/Apple-TV-Alarm-Clock&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few people have started asking me for my opinion on the fast-growing story about CoverSutra, a mac application for which the developer promised free updates until version 3.0 several years ago but then switched to be exclusive on the Mac App Store with a new 2.x version which old customers would have to rebuy.  I have mixed opinions about this but it gives me some scope to talk not only about the Mac App Store, but also about selling on the internet in general and the lack of understanding by a large amount of the commenting world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the issue at hand first of all, it is essential that you go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sophiestication.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Sophiestication Blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sophiestication.com/blog/coversutra-2-5/&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; that sparked this all off.  The basic details are that version 2.5 was a new update that was to be exclusive on the App Store yet this reneged on a previous promise (made several years ago apparently) that all updates would be free until version 3.0 - users that bought a version recently would now not be able to upgrade to 2.5 without paying $5 on the App Store.  At first glance, the fault would appear to lie with the developer and, to be fair, that is still my general opinion.  A lot of people have backed the developer purely because of the horrendous abuse that she has suffered on her blog (which I&#39;ll come to shortly) but that is to forgive something because of abuse after the fact which, in this case, is actually immaterial.  She promised a free update until version 3.0 and didn&#39;t deliver it so in a way people are allowed to be pissed especially when she remarks that &quot;a migration from the previous standalone version is sadly not possible.... however I lowered the price to $4.99 so there&#39;s no reason not to pick up a copy for new features&quot;.  This was excaberated by her fanning the flames in the comments by telling everyone to &quot;chill down&quot; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the comments got worse (and needlessly aggressive in tone), it became apparent that a lot of the problem was people not understanding why they couldn&#39;t get updates through the Mac App Store and that the developer had forgotten the previous promise that was made.  I&#39;ll come to the Mac App Store shortly but the issue of a promise could have been dealt with in a far more dignified way.  Upon being reminded about the promise, she should have instantly made a simple apology and outlined what had happened.  Instead, she told an already riled crowd to &quot;calm down&quot; and made the situation far worse.  In essence, the initial promise should never have been made.  Upon it&#39;s revelation, the 2.5 version should have been recompiled to be distributed through the Sparkle system she was using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‘s true that I could have made version 2.5 available through the legacy Sparkle updater. But maintaining two builds, one for the App Store and one with the serial number checks, was too time consuming for me. Precious time better spend on the actual update and my other apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to disagree with this assessment.  I agree wholeheartedly that maintaining two distribution channels is difficult and, if I were to launch a mac application tomorrow, I would only choose the Mac App Store.  However, if you have an update system in place, there is not much effort involved to publish an update through it (as that is the essence of the system).  This does not mean she would need to sell version 2.5 on her website, just push an update through her existing system for the old users.  That would have solved all the problems and taken considerably less effort than it&#39;s now going to take to &quot;restore sanity&quot; to her users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s very easy at this point to blame the Mac App Store for this issue.  After all, if Apple allowed upgrade pricing then this wouldn&#39;t be happening.  I disagree with this also as the Mac App Store is not trying to be the all encompassing place for mac software as is highlighted by their terms of what is and isn&#39;t allowed in the store.  They are creating a store for certain kinds of apps sold in the way in which Apple sells its own apps.  iLife for example comes out almost every year but there is no upgrade pricing - it&#39;s priced cheap (for mass consumption) and a new version is something worth buying so you pay for it.  You don&#39;t pay for the *.x releases mid-cycle (as these are bug fixes and tiny new features) but the next version generally adds a great deal.  You could say &quot;I&#39;ve been a customer for x years - I &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; a lower price due to customer loyalty&quot; but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  This seems to be the same philosophy that Apple are trying to encourage in the Mac App Store, namely price your apps low but customers have to buy again when a new version comes out. Conversely, your version updates had better be good as your customers won&#39;t be happy if you put out a new version that they have to pay for again but doesn&#39;t add anything good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying for new versions of things is something that we, as customers, should be used to.  After all, when Sonic the Hedgehog 2 came out on the Mega Drive, we didn&#39;t complain that we already owned Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and version 2 only added new levels and a new character so why should we pay full price?  You buy the next version again as it adds new things that you want.  This is exactly the same in desktop apps as it is for mobile apps or computer games.  The pricing actually becomes immaterial compared to the philosophy of &quot;buy new versions of apps&quot;. If your app is priced well, then people will pay for the new version.  If they don&#39;t, then you got the money for the old version and you&#39;ve learned that the features you added in your new version aren&#39;t actually as good as you thought they were.  Do some market research, start work on a new version, and hope that they&#39;ll pay next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something that we need to get used to.  As an app developer myself, it appalls me that people think that having paid $5 for an app they should get free upgrades for life.  That isn&#39;t sustainable, economical, or fair to developers.  However, the onus is also on us, the developers, to make each version so good that people will pay for $5 again for each new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, going back to the CoverSutra story, I agree with the developer on one hand but disagree on the other; I agree that going the Mac App Store route is the best way and that each new version should be charged for separately.  I do disagree however with her going Mac App Store exclusive on updates for her previous customers when she had promised free upgrades for a certain period of time.  She didn&#39;t need to make that promise but she did (presumably to make more sales at the time) so those free updates need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final thought on all this is about commenting on the internet in general.  As you may have noticed, my website has recently been redesigned and one of the features I&#39;ve redeveloped is the blog.  It no longer has a commenting system.  This is by design as I&#39;ve noticed the deterioration of comments over the last couple of years.  The facelessness of the internet means that people now act in a way that they wouldn&#39;t in a normal conversation.  The comments on Sophia&#39;s blog are nothing short of sickening regardless of the rights or wrongs of the decision taken and that is exactly one of the reasons why I won&#39;t let people comment on my blog anymore.  I&#39;ve never attracted such aggression before but the fact that it seems to be slowly becoming the norm on the internet troubles me. If people want to reply to my blog posts, they can contact me on Twitter (where I can reply directly knowing that they&#39;ve heard back from me - commenting systems don&#39;t always inform the commentator of a reply), post a reply on their own blog, or email me directly.  That way, they aren&#39;t anonymous (leading to more reasonable discourse) and I can reply back to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my big hopes for 2011 is that iTunes will add a &quot;reply&quot; feature to commentators so that we don&#39;t get the same level of abuse and stupid comments on the reviews of Mac and iPhone apps as that is going downhill currently - many people leave comments on apps saying &quot;this doesn&#39;t work&quot; but without the power to reply it&#39;s near impossible to let someone know a problem has been fixed.  Most developers do want to help and aren&#39;t trying to screw the customer over but with the anonymous reviews and comments left by the countless numbers of people with bad attitudes, it&#39;s very easy to stop caring about the customer.  I can&#39;t help but think that the whole CoverSutra thing wouldn&#39;t have exploded as much as it did if Sophia had comments disabled on her blog...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My take on Microsoft's Keynote at CES 2011</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I did two things I didn&#39;t think would ever happen; I stayed up until 2:30am to watch Steve Ballmer give a presentation and I installed Silverlight on my Macbook Air.  Why you ask?  As someone in the &quot;mobile development space&quot;, I felt it was my duty to not just focus on Apple&#39;s keynotes (fantastic though they are) and instead take a listen to a few other CEO&#39;s, especially when they could be announcing something important in the area of tablet PCs.  Last year, Steve Ballmer famously introduced &quot;slates&quot; to the world at a time when Apple hadn&#39;t yet launched a tablet and all the rumour blogs were pointing at the possible name for a new device being the iSlate.  It struck me then that by suddenly calling the tablets he was announcing slates (when nobody had previously) that Ballmer was just doing some showboating as he was launching something before Apple.  However, the iPad (I like to imagine Steve Jobs put out the iSlate name purely to fool Ballmer whilst all along knowing he was going to call it the iPad) launched shortly afterwards to international success.  In the year since, no other tablet has gained as much media attention or sales.  The HP slates that Ballmer announced at CES 2010 have conveniently never materialised.  So, I was curious to see if slates would be making a comeback and if we&#39;d actually see an iPad-killer.  As an iPad developer, I thought it best that I see the competition as it happened rather than waiting until morning for the news.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from any tablet announcements, I was also curious about what was happening with Windows Phone 7 and any news about upcoming games for the Kinect.  I know very little about Windows Phone 7 (about from the UI looks a bit better than Android&#39;s) so any extra knowledge would be an asset.  The Kinect, on the other hand, is a device I&#39;ve owned since day one and absolutely love - I&#39;m just keen to know what they are bringing to it apart from fitness and dance games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Opening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 2:30am. I refresh Safari and nothing. 2:35am. Nothing. 2:40am. Nothing.  Finally, at 2:47am, somebody from CES comes out after showing off a video to showcase CES that looks like it was made pre-2000.  It was a seriously bad video with the only indication it was new being that it had a song that&#39;s only just been in the charts as a backing track.  It was painful.  The only thing more painful was the guy introducing who seemed to speak corporate bullshit (I have no idea what half his sentences meant) and the odd reference to a book he&#39;d written that he was trying to plug.  This was topped only by his introduction for Steve Ballmer in which he called the Microsoft CEO &quot;focused&quot;.  In any case, the music started and we all expected Steve to come &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc&quot;&gt;bounding out like a maniac as per usual&lt;/a&gt;but he didn&#39;t.  I was genuinely surprised to find Steve behaving and sounding a little bit like a normal person throughout!  Anyway, he briefly talks about how successful Microsoft has been in the past year (let&#39;s face it, we needed reminding) and how he wanted to talk about Kinect, Windows Phone 7, and then Windows itself.  I&#39;ll give you my opinion of each in the same order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kinect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the Kinect. It&#39;s a fantastic device and some of the homebrew apps that people have written to use it have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/17095170&quot;&gt;truly inspiring&lt;/a&gt;.  For all that, the launch titles were fairly unimpressive with the most popular games being Kinect Adventures (that comes free with it), Dance Central (dance game from the people behind Rock Band), and Your Shape: Fitness Evolved (which has an amazing UI and gives you the socially awkward power of laughing at anyone who still uses Wii Fit).  However, this isn&#39;t gaming for the masses; this is trying to be a Nintendo Wii with an albeit better controller.  I should point out at this point that Steve did put a lot of emphasis into the marketing slogan of &quot;You... are....... the................. controller&quot; as if we haven&#39;t heard it a million times already.  Anyway, were we going to find out about some awesome new software for the Kinect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm... no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &quot;big&quot; announcement was that the Netflix interface would now be controllable with the Kinect. I already thought it was but then I&#39;m not in the US so I don&#39;t get to see any Netflix interface!  Next up was that Hulu would be coming to the Kinect.  Now that is a good announcement, but alas, it&#39;s US only as well so not terribly exciting for me personally.  There was some talk about some more ESPN stuff including some very awkward &quot;trash talk&quot; about a college football game and then that was it for the live demo.  And then Steve came back onstage but this time in the form of his Xbox avatar in order to tell us about Avatar Kinect.  When I&#39;d first heard the name Avatar Kinect about 3 hours before the presentation, I assumed it was going to be some amazing Kinect powered tie-in with the 3D film Avatar. How wrong I was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2011/01/Avatar_Kinect_Tailgate_06_web-500x281.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Avatar Kinect&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-431&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avatar Kinect is a free piece of software that will be available in a future Xbox update.  It allows you to use your Xbox Avatar to talk to friends by putting you in a number of different settings with your friends Avatars (e.g. a news desk or a car park) where you can then chat or record movies, etc.  The technology is pretty clever in that it will do lip syncing and animate facial features (Steve showed this off with his eyebrows) but I can&#39;t help but feel that you&#39;d use the app once to try it out and then never use it again.  Why would you chat with your friends through your avatar when you have a proper webcam built into the Kinect and the software to use it?  It was hardly earth-shattering news so the Xbox portion of the evening was pretty disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Windows Phone 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I don&#39;t know a huge amount about Windows Phone 7 so I was kind of looking forward to seeing this section to try and understand it a bit better.  The first thing that Steve points out is that the Windows Phone 7 is actually really good, it&#39;s just not very popular as people haven&#39;t seen it.  We are encouraged that by showing it to people, they really like it and thing it&#39;s better than other phones on the market.  This smacks of Project Mojave to me - to those that don&#39;t remember, Project Mojave was a Microsoft marketing experiment in which they tried to combat the negative tide of opinion about Windows Vista by putting focus groups together to try the next version of Windows (naming it Windows Mojave) but instead gave them Windows Vista.  This led to lots of video of people saying &quot;this is great&quot; and &quot;so much better than Vista&quot; before then being told the truth.  The end result was supposed to be that Vista is great and people need to use it rather than bitch about it but the actual feeling you got from it was that Microsoft has a real problem with it&#39;s marketing department.  This appears to be true of Windows Phone 7 as well if the only reason it isn&#39;t the biggest selling phone of the year is because people haven&#39;t used it or don&#39;t know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, now was the time to show it off.  So, did they do a Steve Jobs style gradual walkthrough or a nice video to show off it&#39;s strengths?  No.  They got a &quot;chief goatherder for two, young, rambunctious kids&quot; who seemed to be on some medical grade drugs to do it.  Words can&#39;t describe how off-putting Liz Sloan is so I&#39;m just going to embed the 8 minute segment she did below.  If you can get through 30 seconds without wanting to scream then you did better than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/rsl97vZHOJk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, her presentational style is such that I quickly forgot about the phone as I was concentrating on her so much trying to work out just what she was on.  That isn&#39;t good for a phone which is described as &quot;a good phone if you show it to someone&quot; as we weren&#39;t seeing the phone, just her.  Other things that riled me were that she thinks it&#39;s a &quot;great phone for people like us&quot; whilst talking to the audience but she actually means &quot;people like her&quot;.  The audience wasn&#39;t made up of busy mums who want to get tasks done on their phone quickly - it was made up of tech nerds who were going to a 4 day conference about technology.  These are the kind of people that want to get lost in their phones every day and never come out.  In addition, her description of copy and paste (a feature which is a long time coming - yes, I know it took a while on the iPhone as well but you don&#39;t launch an &quot;iPhone killer&quot; without it) was borderline patronising and nearly every task she did I could do at the same speed on an iPhone or Android phone so I don&#39;t follow the supposed speed increase which she was talking about.  The stat of &quot;5500 apps in our store&quot; was also repeated far too much - that isn&#39;t a figure to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best piece for me though was a dig at Google that went all wrong.  Liz tried to point out that Bing on the Windows Phone 7 pushes the most relevant pieces to the top so you don&#39;t have to hunt around to find information.  The demonstration given was a search for &quot;Miami Heat&quot; which then showed the score from last night at the top of the search results &quot;instead of a lot of blue links that then brings me to the answer&quot; (read Google Search Results).  I thought this a little odd so I searched for &quot;Miami Heat&quot; in Google and, as I suspected, the scores for the last 3 games were shown right up top.  Liz passionately explains how this breakthrough (*cough*) also worked for things like stocks and weather which I&#39;m pretty sure show up in Google in the same way as well (along with cinema times, maths calculations, and a host of other things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Windows Phone 7 segment was pretty terrible.  The highlight was probably Steve showing off how Xbox Live works on the phone and the announcement of a pinball game that connects with Fable 3 to give you gold.  This was however quickly marred by a video showing how great games are on Windows Phone 7 that mainly featured iOS games which have been ported...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we got to the final round; Windows itself.  Unfortunately Microsoft had already announced the biggest thing some 4 hours earlier which was that Windows was now being rebuilt to work on SoC processors (estimated time: 18-24 months) but that didn&#39;t stop them giving us another 15 minute demo of what that looks like.  Aside from that, there was very little to say.  A few laptops and tablets were briefly demoed and I&#39;d like to talk about two of them which caught my eye; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acer.com/iconia/&quot;&gt;Acer Iconia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/buy/featured/asus.aspx&quot;&gt;ASUS EEE Slate EP121&lt;/a&gt; (just rolls of the tongue that one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acer Iconia&lt;/strong&gt; - this new Windows 7 laptop looks a little like a large Nintendo DS due to it&#39;s dual screen setup but unlike the DS, both screens are touch-enabled.  The demo looked ok apart from a few UI issues such as tapping the tilted screen (remember Steve Jobs saying how they&#39;d never do this as every time they tested it people hated it?) and having a folder stretch over both screens leading to a big plastic bar half way between your viewing area.  However, the thing that irritated me the most was the gesture to bring up the onscreen keyboard.  Since seeing the demo, I&#39;ve asked a few people &quot;what do you think Microsoft would choose a suitable gesture for bringing up a keyboard&quot;?  Most people said a swipe up or even a two or three fingered swipe in a direction.  Instead, Microsoft decided that a 10-fingered gesture (must be the world&#39;s first) was best - you have to push all 10 of your digits onto the lower screen at the same time to bring up the keyboard.  Without having used the Iconia myself I can&#39;t really comment on how it works but I can&#39;t imagine that typing on a glass display is going to be particularly good for long usage.  The iPad is great but you wouldn&#39;t use it to type an essay and entering any text is really a bit of a chore - I would hate to have that as my main input option on what is supposed to be a fully fledged PC, not just a tablet for light app usage.  Having said that, it&#39;s a very different concept and I&#39;m going to be interested to see consumer feedback on the dual-screen approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASUS EEE Slate EP121&lt;/strong&gt; - This was the main tablet that was shown off and is actually a full PC inside a 12.1&quot; tablet form factor. It&#39;s running an Intel Core i5 and can have upto 4 gigs of RAM in it.  They seem to have hedged their bets for input methods by bundling it with both a wireless keyboard and a stylus but you can also use normal touch and a virtual keyboard.  The thing that struck me was a) it looks heavy and too bulky to be a convenient tablet and b) the input methods don&#39;t look good.  If you have a tablet, you shouldn&#39;t need a physical keyboard.  Yes, you can get them for the iPad but why would you?  If you need to do a lot of typing you are probably better off with a real laptop rather than a tablet device.  The demo showed an excel spreadsheet being controlled with touch at one point (with a pinch gesture to zoom) and then using a stylus to edit a spreadsheet.  I can&#39;t imagine anything worse than trying to fill in a spreadsheet on a 12.1&quot; tablet with a stylus but there you are. I haven&#39;t used it, so again I&#39;m speculating, but I have a feeling that this device is going to get very hot and run out of battery very quickly (they say 3+ hours on their website!).  For $100 less than the asking price (which is $1,099), you could get an 11&quot; MacBook Air with a higher screen resolution, longer battery, far less weight, and a much smaller form factor.  A MacBook Air could also run Windows 7 if that&#39;s what you want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keynote ended with a look at the Microsoft Surface which is now in a smaller form factor, is slightly cheaper,  and has support for 20 fingers in multitouch gestures rather than 10. That was pretty much all I could glean about it!  I do like the Surface but I wish they&#39;d spent as much time as they have on that working on a truly mobile tablet OS rather than trying to shoehorn Windows 7 onto every device.  Windows 7 may be good for some tasks (I don&#39;t like it personally) but it is not a suitable OS for a tablet in the same way that OS X wouldn&#39;t have worked on a tablet.  Android made a similar decision when they tried to put a mobile phone OS onto a tablet.  Apple made the right choice by making an optimised OS for it and that is why it has succeeded and other tablets have failed (although it will be interesting to see how the new Android 3.0 UI, supposedly optimised for tablets, will work out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I was pretty disappointed with the Microsoft Keynote.  Sure there were some interesting ideas being floated with the dual-screen Acer laptop and the Windows for SoC announcement but the majority was just rehashing things that have already been demoed or shown off in the past and irritating people showing off features that most mobile phones now have. Microsoft have a lot of catching up to do in the mobile world and I think this year is going to hit them pretty hard. &lt;/p&gt;

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2010/11/04/contact-forms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 14 years, I have witnessed the internet expanding rapidly and becoming massively commercialised. With this kind of rampant upscaling, there is always a point at which there are enough people using the system that want to exploit it in some way, usually for monetary gain. With the internet, this has been done rather crudely with the invent of &lt;strong&gt;spam email&lt;/strong&gt;. There are large numbers of servers whose primary aim is to crawl the internet searching for an email address. They then generate a list of these email addresses and sell them to companies who will send out mass emails trying to entice people to buy something or other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this problem has increased (apparently over 85% of all emails sent are spam), web developers have panicked and come up with all sorts of stupid methods to try and prevent it. Most developers won’t output their email address in plain text on a website (or with a mailto link) but instead choose to try and hide it by doing something along the lines of “ben [at] bendodson [dot] com”. This is highly inaccessible and is a real pain to try and decipher sometimes – and besides, a human spammer could read it anyway! Other developers will set up a contact form and then protect it by means of a Captcha system or some other horrendously inaccessible device. These systems are incredibly difficult and time-consuming for able-bodied people to use let alone those with poor eye sight or other disabilities. Even so, these systems have become prevalent across the internet and show no signs of slowing down. Some contact forms now ask basic mathematic questions to prove you’re human completely over looking the fact that every one of these systems can eventually be thwarted as spam-bot developers adapt to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem I have with all of these systems is that they impose limits on web users and slow them down. They pass all responsibility to the user and treat them like spam until proven innocent (by means of a test) rather than just accepting that these things happen and using an automated system that can filter spam from real conversation.
Therefore, I’ve decided to take a stand against this and publish my email address loud and clear with a link that will open it in your email client of choice. If I get spammed, it really doesn’t bother me – I have a “junk mail” folder which has protected my inbox for a very long time and will continue to do so. Please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;  – I look forward to hearing from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, I expanded my &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowallatools.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla Tools&lt;/a&gt; website (a companion site for the popular geo-location game &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla&lt;/a&gt;) to include a new feature known as the Item Finder.  It works by displaying a list of spots in any area you choose, and them removing those that don&#39;t have items you are missing from your vault.  I always knew that this would be a controversial feature and that I&#39;d need to write a piece explaining why I had built it - now that a few people have complained that it is &quot;changing the core nature of the game&quot;, it is probably an apt time to publish my opinion on why this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I began work on my Gowalla Tools project, people have consistently been in contact to ask me to make an item finder.  They were frustrated that it seemed so difficult to find existing items in their areas when they were so abundant in other areas.  For example, in the UK it&#39;s very difficult to find a &quot;Cowboy Hat&quot; as these are only available in spots marked as &quot;Saloons&quot; (of which we have very few).  However, a few of these rare items have made it to our shores thanks to random items being seeded into new packs (meaning new players have a chance of having a rare item such as this available to them from the start) which are then dropped at locations to make them founded spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first version of Gowalla Tools, I added a feature which allowed you to see what items were available at any spot you chose.  This was not exactly game changing as you could work this out yourself on the Gowalla website by seeing what items had been dropped and picked up until you ended up knowing what was there - my site simply did it faster.  When I was initially asked to add a search feature, I was hesitant as I felt it took a lot away from the game and made it simply an item collection game similar to Packrat (which is how the vast majority of players came to find Gowalla) rather than a game about going to places.  I actually felt so strongly about changing the game into item collection that I edited the first draft so that items appeared in a popup window rather than inline - this meant it took a good 3 seconds or so before you could view the items at a spot and thus made it so that you couldn&#39;t just click around and see what was there.  Aside from my issues around gameplay, there were technical constraints as searching that many spots would place heavy demand on both mine and Gowalla&#39;s servers so I ruled it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a month or so later that I suddenly started to hit a brick wall with items.  I was missing around 10 items all of which were proving to be incredibly elusive as they were created mainly for the Texas area (e.g. Longhorn).  I realised I was spending a lot of time on the Gowalla Tools map clicking around trying to find out what items were available in my area and found quite a few items I had been missing that way.  Gowalla also stepped up their game and introduced version 1.3 of their app which allowed you to vault items from within the application - they were starting to take items more seriously so my site needed to do similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to get underway with a brand new site and introduced the &lt;strong&gt;13 days of Gowalla Tools Christmas&lt;/strong&gt; - a daring attempt to build 13 new tools for the site within the 25 days leading up to Christmas.  The first tool was obvious to me; the map needed to be radically overhauled and easier to search and view spots.  I improved the item offering quickly by showing you what items were at a spot and highlighted those items that were missing from your vault.  On day 2, I added the item search.  It didn&#39;t work the same way as many people had hoped (e.g. type in &quot;Longhorn&quot; and it&#39;ll show you all the spots that exists) due to the technical constraints.  However, it did allow you to load all the spots in your area and then remove all but those that had items you needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial feedback was excellent and I had felt that my compromise between ease of use and item searching had been well balanced.  However, I was recently alerted to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/gowalla/topics/friend_only_spots#reply_1644265&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/gowalla/&quot;&gt;GetSatisfaction&lt;/a&gt; (and several tweets) that felt that the new feature was game changing for Gowalla and was tantamount to cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main reason for playing Gowalla is nothing to do with items - it&#39;s about finding new places and visiting those places.  It&#39;s about finding interesting spots in your neighbourhood that you may never have known were there and then going out and visiting them.  In my opinion, items were added in order to lure more people from Packrat and to make it seem more like a game but the key thing is locations.  Yes it could be perceived that the Gowalla Tools Item Finder makes it unfair to those that knew where items were previously who are now unable to get them as somebody else has now found them, but that&#39;s all part of the game.  You can&#39;t pick up items unless you are checked in at a location so if you don&#39;t go there, you can&#39;t have it.  If someone else gets there first, then the item is theirs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that has annoyed me from the start about Gowalla is the rights that people have given themselves in terms of &quot;that item is mine&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to create that spot so you can&#39;t&quot;.  There are no &quot;rules&quot; in Gowalla apart from &quot;first come, first served&quot;.  The claim that this is game changing is ruled out completely by the fact that Gowalla are fully aware of the Gowalla Tools website and support it (with many of their developers retweeting and using the functionality).  I speak with the developers frequently to let them know when I&#39;m releasing new tools that I feel conflict with the core gameplay or could interfere with their servers (e.g. by placing too much demand).  I would of course remove any tool they felt violated these rules and as yet no request has been made - only encouragement  to do more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, there are a lot of people using the Item Finder in the way I intended.  I received a lot of tweets yesterday from people thanking me as they had found an item at a spot and were now going their specially to get it.  Some people were travelling up to an hour out of their way to get an item and I think that&#39;s great!  They were playing the game, going outside to new places rather than waiting and hoping that nobody would know an item they would quite like was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The item Finder does not change the core gameplay of Gowalla in any way - it adds to it by showing you spots that are of interest to you.  There are people who are affected (namely those on the Android platform) but unfortunately that is a shortcoming on Gowalla&#39;s part in not implementing the same level of gameplay for all users.  They shouldn&#39;t have launched the Android version without all the core game components but this does not mean that Gowalla Tools should be limited.  There are several people on devices that can&#39;t play Gowalla who would like to - should we horde items away for them?  Of course not!  Items can still be obtained in the traditional ways and as yet they aren&#39;t limited to batches in the same way Packrat items are so I don&#39;t see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks I&#39;ll be releasing more tools that push forward this key feature of getting out there and discovering new places and todays new tool (Flickr Integration) hopefully expands this more by giving you more visual information about a place before you get there.  I stick firmly by my decision to release the item finder and I hope that the majority of you will agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now get out there and start Gowalla&#39;ing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Apple Magic Mouse: Necessary upgrade or expensive luxury?</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/31/the-apple-magic-mouse-necessary-upgrade-or-expensive-luxury/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple recently announced the introduction of their latest peripheral, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/magicmouse/&quot;&gt;the Magic Mouse&lt;/a&gt; (so called due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/143202/2009/10/mightymouse_trademark.html&quot;&gt;trademark problems&lt;/a&gt; with the existing &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; name).  The new mouse offers the same multitouch features as found in the trackpads of recent MacBooks and of course the iPhone and iPod Touch. But is it any good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous Apple Mice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous model (the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;) was a complete disaster in my opinion and the only Apple product apart from the Tiger Xserve that I have never been able to defend (even as a devout fanboy).  The main problem was that the scroll button (or &#39;nipple&#39;) would get clogged with dirt so easily that it would invariably stop working after a couple of weeks heavy usage.  The official Apple solution to this (which has since been pulled from the KnowledgeBase) was to turn it upside down and bang it in your palm!  Whilst it had a couple of benefits in terms of OS X integration (such as activating Exposé by squeezing) these features quite often generated more problems than they solved (such as activating Exposé by accidental squeezing).  So how does the Magic Mouse differ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magic Mouse has no buttons, no squeezing, and no cable.  Like the unibody MacBooks, it has gone for a simple look using the minimum number of parts; one piece of aluminium and one piece of glass.  It is incredibly short (in terms of height) compared to other mice whilst being slightly longer than others.  With no distinguishing buttons and a symmetrical shape, the only visual aid to placing it the right way round is the standard Apple logo displayed on the top.  In my opinion, the design is beautiful yet simplistic (as you would expect from any recent Apple product) but would look at home in a museum of modern art.  Not many people care about the aesthetics of a mouse (which is strange considering it&#39;s prominent location in most homes) but now I&#39;ve had this on my desk, I&#39;d find it very difficult to go back to something uglier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you&#39;ve even got it to your desk you are struck by the beauty of the device.  The packaging is incredibly similar to the new iPods (which makes a lot of sense) but it still amazed me to see just how little packaging was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2455/4061085886_937419aed9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Magic Mouse packaging&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult not to pick up the Magic Mouse in the Apple Store and not be impressed with the way it is packaged.  This is how all packaging should be in the modern world - I&#39;m not talking just about technology (although there is large scope for improvement) but in everything from food to clothing.  Smaller packaging means not only that you can put more product in a store but also that you save fuel from transportation (as you can move more units in the same lorries / boats leading to less trips) and minimise wasteful plastic packaging.  I was impressed when I found out that the mouse came with batteries (very rare these days) but even more impressed when I discovered they were already in the device which was simply turned off.  This saves a huge amount of space and more plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Functionality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other commentators have noted, there is no &quot;wow&quot; moment with this mouse.  By this, they mean that the majority of Apple products have that initial euphoria when you use it for the first time (e.g. when you first unlock the iPhone or when you lift the MacBook out of it&#39;s stunning packaging) but this mouse doesn&#39;t have that.  You just use it.  However, what it does have is a strange sensation roughly after an hours use when you try to go back to using a normal mouse.  You find the scrolling isn&#39;t as intuitive and that you&#39;ve been using the multitouch features without even thinking about it.  It is a very easy mouse to get used to and it is that which provides the &quot;wow&quot; as you realise you have been completely taken in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of setup, it&#39;s a standard bluetooth mouse so a quick trip to the &quot;mouse&quot; page in Settings will have it set up in know time.  As of the time of writing, you need to download an update via &quot;Software Update&quot; to take advantage of the multitouch gestures but when OS X 10.6.2 is released it will be built into the OS by default.  The only negative here is that the update is 62MB which is a little excessive - this is most likely due to the videos that show you how to use the gestures in a similar way to the videos found on the MacBooks to show you how to use the trackpad.  In any case, setup is quick and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, there are very few actual uses of the multitouch.  Clicking is performed by a physical click (not just tapping as per the trackpads) but there is only one button.  The multitouch comes into play by detecting where your finger is on the surface and then linking that up to whether it is a primary or secondary click - this is very useful if you are left-handed or ambidextrous (as I am) as you can quickly switch the mouse to your other hand and it still feels comfortable thanks to the symmetrical design.  The only other two uses are scrolling (a simple case of moving your finger around on the surface - you can go up, down, left, right, and diagonal which is useful for zooming in photos, etc) and the two finger swipe which lets you go backwards and forwards through browser history and photos.  Apple also point out you can zoom into a page by holding the control button on the keyboard and swiping your finger up and down but this has always been possible by holding control and using a scroll wheel so I wouldn&#39;t describe it as a unique function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Criticism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appear to be two main criticisms of this device if you read the forums or the reviews pages on the Apple Store; size and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have found the size uncomfortable as it&#39;s so much shorter than previous mice.  However, I note that most of these reviews were from people going to their local Apple Store and trying it rather than at home.  I had read these reviews and so when I got to the store I made a point of squatting down to try it as the benches in the store are very low (meaning you&#39;re not holding the mouse as you normally would).  This made a huge difference to how it sat in my hand and so I think a lot of these reviews just stem from this problem.  I would never buy a mouse that cost this much money without trying it out first but it is important that you try and recreate how you would use it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem of functionality is much more valid in my mind.  For a multitouch device, this mouse uses a woeful amount of multitouch features.  When it was first announced I was expecting all the features of my trackpad such as pinch, rotating, zooming, 3-4 fingered swiping, and maybe a few extras as well.  Without this option (and the customisation that goes with it) there are just too few buttons for a lot of consumers.  The squeeze buttons on the Mighty Mouse may have been annoying to some but at least it gave you a way to control Exposé from your mouse - something that can save a lot of time over the course of a day.  Likewise with no middle button control you can&#39;t get to your dashboard or spaces easily (or use it like a PC mouse for opening new tabs in browsers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory on this lack of functionality is that Apple know they are going to get negative reviews that focus intently on this issue.  They will therefore release an update in a month or so which fixes it and adds full multitouch support which will then write off all of the negative reviews.  In this way, they are able to choose the negative issue that people will focus on safe in the knowledge they can resolve it later on and make it seem that everybody loves the device.  People who had an issue with the device can&#39;t then say &quot;x is bad about it&quot; as their original review will have focused on the multitouch issue as the only negative.  From what I&#39;ve seen of Apple&#39;s marketing machine (one of the best in the world to my mind) and my studies of politics, this is exactly the kind of controlled negativity that I would expect.  I guess we&#39;ll see if I&#39;m right in a month or so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is the mouse worth £55 (or $69 - strange currency conversion there...) - at the moment I would say no simply due to the lack of features supported by the multitouch.  If these are corrected in a future update (and I&#39;m confident they will be) then this will be one of the finest mice on the market, but at the moment it feels as if it&#39;s full potential is being restricted.  There is no question that this is a beautiful device, but the functionality needs to match the aesthetics before I can fully endorse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 11th Nov 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; I was recommended &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=195&quot;&gt;BetterTouchTool&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ricklecoat&quot;&gt;@ricklecoat&lt;/a&gt; which is a free app that enables some extra features of the mouse.  For instance, my Magic Mouse now reveals my desktop when I slide two fingers up / down and does Exposé when I tap (yes tap, not click) with three fingers.  Has improved my productivity no end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gallery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve put together a few shots of the unpacking of the Magic Mouse as well as comparing it with a few of my older mice. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/sets/72157622701686080/&quot;&gt;on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to pitch an app idea to an iPhone developer</title>

      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/16/how-to-pitch-an-app-idea-to-an-iphone-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my appearance on The Gadget Show &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/14/social-beacon-developing-an-iphone-app-for-the-gadget-show/&quot;&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve been inundated with people emailing me with ideas for iPhone applications.  The majority of them have no understanding of the development aspects (which is fair enough) but have ideas for apps they want me to build, usually with payment via the profit made.  I&#39;ve had quite a few interesting ones come through, but some have been suggested with very little thought or realism applied.  I decided to create this article to show prospective idea senders how an idea should be presented along with a few answers to common questions I&#39;ve received&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research your idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing worse than replying to 2 or 3 emails in which the sender is being cagey about their &quot;brilliant new idea&quot; only to discover (often after spending time signing, scanning, and sending an NDA) that it is actually an idea for which there  are over 250 apps available on the store.  The key thing before contacting a developer is to make sure that your idea has not been done already.  If it has, then either think of something else or find a unique selling point in your app that will make it stand out from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make sure your app is relevant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your idea hasn&#39;t been done before?  The App Store has been open for over a year with over 65,000 applications so the next question should be &quot;why hasn&#39;t it been done&quot;.  There are three answers to this question: it&#39;s impossible, it&#39;s not a good idea, or it&#39;s unique.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impossible:&lt;/strong&gt; When I say &quot;impossible&quot;, I mean that you&#39;ve come up with something that the iPhone SDK won&#39;t allow (it may still be a good idea).  For example, you may have an idea to download soundclips off the internet and store them in the iPod library.  A good idea in theory but the iPod library only has read access so you are limited to what you can do.  There are several rules within the iPhone SDK which limit what can be done so be prepared that your idea may not be possible within those confines - there may, however, be workarounds (e.g. in the example above you could build a custom application to play the soundclips you&#39;ve downloaded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Idea:&lt;/strong&gt; The most common bad ideas I&#39;ve had sent tend to be duplicating the functionality of an existing website into an iPhone app.  You might have a killer idea on your website and be the market leader in a certain arena.  This does not mean that converting it directly to the iPhone is going to be a good idea.  If your idea is working on a website already, then it is already accessible from an iPhone (provided it&#39;s not made in flash) so there is little benefit to making a custom application apart from it&#39;ll look slightly better.  It may be that there are a huge number of potential iPhone users who are put off by your website running on the device.  In that case, you should consider making a web app.  This is a way of using standard HTML and CSS to make a website look like an iPhone application but takes no extra knowledge than that of building your regular site.  I&#39;ve built a few web apps myself and found it to be incredibly easy if you are using something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/iphone-universal/&quot;&gt;UiUiKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique:&lt;/strong&gt; You&#39;ve checked the App Store and found no trace of your idea, you are certain it&#39;s possible to do with the features of the device, and it&#39;s not a simple port of an existing website into an application. In that case your app is probably a unique endeavour and should definitely be pursued!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Know your audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&#39;ve been pitching for web development work in the past, I&#39;ve often had clients say to me &quot;we should definitely make an iPhone app for this as well&quot; to which I usually reply &quot;why&quot;.  There is an unhealthy obsession at the moment with making applications simply for the fact that it shows you are modern.  However, you can easily spend a large sum of money building an application for a small bit of street cred only to find out that none of your target audience actually use iPhones (or wouldn&#39;t use your application anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your idea is simply duplicating functionality of your website, then you shouldn&#39;t make it an iPhone application (or even a web app) unless more than 20% of your visitors are using an iPhone or you&#39;ve had a lot of people ask for an app.  You wouldn&#39;t suddenly start supporting Internet Explorer 5.5 on the mac again but quite often you&#39;ll find more people visiting your website with that than with an iPhone yet people will often overlook simple statistics to try and seem more modern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t make custom apps or websites for devices or browsers that your users aren&#39;t using!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding development costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An iPhone app is not an easy thing to build and so, like a house or a website, you are paying for the expertise of the developer you commission to create your application.  If you believe your idea is unique and you are going to make a large profit from it, then you need to pay your developer for the application in a one-off fee the same way that you would pay a builder or any other tradesman.  &lt;strike&gt;However, if you don&#39;t have the finance to pay to have your idea built, then some developers will be open to the idea of building the idea for you for free but then taking a percentage of the profit that comes in from selling the app.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Negotiating for development costs is often very similar to the Dragon&#39;s Den program in that you will negotiate in terms of equity (how much of the profit you are willing to share) in order to get an expert to build the application.  However, where this often falls down is with prospective clients offering around 20% equity.  If you come to the table with nothing but an idea (and aren&#39;t planning on doing any designing, building, or marketing) then you can&#39;t expect to find a developer that will build your app and agree to taking a small percentage.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;In my own case, I prefer to be paid for the application but I will occasionally deal in terms of equity if I think the idea is good enough.  Having said that, I refuse to take less than 50% if I&#39;m expected to build an application from the ground up with no other form of payment - most other developers are the same.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 22nd 2015:&lt;/strong&gt; Whilst this was the case in 2009, it certainly isn&#39;t the case in 2015 and the vast majority of developers will not work for any form of equity. Please ready my new article &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/12/22/ios-developers-dont-work-for-free/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS developers don&#39;t work for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that it is not possible to give a straight up cost for an application before you&#39;ve heard the idea.  I&#39;ve received several enquiries of the sort &quot;can you tell me how much it&#39;ll cost to get an app built&quot;.  Pricing is generally based on the amount of time required so if you want a basic utility then it will cost a great deal less than a complex 3D game.  Bear in mind that you may be asking your developer to build a website or server software to run your applications (if you plan on using push notifications for example) and so these should be factored into your financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; with all applications, Apple takes approximately 30% of the sale of each application to cover the costs of the App Store.  This means that for every 59p sale, you keep approximately 42p.  You are paid at the end of each month by Apple but you are paid by territory and if you haven&#39;t earned over $150 in that territory then the amount rolls over to the next month that you do.  For example, if you made $100 in one month in the USA, then you are under the $150 threshold.  That rolls over to the next month.  If you then made another $100 you would be over the threshold so at the end of that month you&#39;d be sent $200.  When you are negotiating with an iPhone developer, be sure to clarify if they are talking of their percentage in terms of sales price (before Apple takes it&#39;s 30% cut) or profit (after Apple has taken it&#39;s cut).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building an app on your own&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple provides all of the tools you need to make an iPhone application via it&#39;s developer website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/iphone/&quot;&gt;http://developer.apple.com/iphone/&lt;/a&gt; although you will need to be using a mac with an intel processor.  You can&#39;t build iPhone applications on windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the free SDK that Apple provides, you can use all of the features of the iPhone and test them in the iPhone Simulator that is also provided.  You can&#39;t, however, run the code on your own device or submit it to the App Store.  To do that, you&#39;ll need to get a developer license which costs $99 per year and can be purchased through the developer website above.  Once you have the license, you&#39;ll be able to generate provisioning profiles for your apps which will enable it to run on your own device or up to 100 other devices (e.g. friends, colleagues, testers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All apps are written in Objective-C so I&#39;d highly recommend you buy a book on the subject.  If you are coming from a web-based background (e.g. PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, .net) then I&#39;d also recommend you start by learning C before moving onto Objective-C.  You may be raring to jump into the SDK and start using things like the accelerometer and location services, but if you don&#39;t know how an array or a dictionary works, then you&#39;ll never be able to build an app that works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting your apps into the App Store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only things you need are your completed application code (that should have been tested extensively in both the simulator and on actual devices) and a developer license.  Once you have these, you are able to generate the correct certificates to publish your application to the App Store.  You will be asked to supply not only text such as descriptions, app title, and keywords, but also screenshots and a 512x512px image of your application icon for use in Apple&#39;s promotional materials so make sure you have these available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual process for submission has been under a lot of criticism but basically you submit your app and then wait for a while (usually around 14 days - Apple have placed an indicator of queue length on the iTunes submission portal now) to find out if your app has been rejected or accepted.  If it&#39;s been rejected then they should supply you with information about what is wrong and how to fix it.  If it&#39;s been accepted, then congratulations, your app is ready for prime time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; a common question seems to be &quot;can I submit an app with your developer license&quot;.  If we were to assume that I built you an iPhone app, then yes I could submit it to the app store using my license saving you $99.  However, this would mean the app appeared under my company name rather than your own and all payments for the app would go into my bank account.  Whilst this is possible, most clients would prefer that their company name is displayed and that all finance goes through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Copyright and other legalities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple checks the application in it&#39;s approval process, it does not take into account copyright or any other legalities of that type.  This means that technically you could steal an idea such as &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;, make a duplicate app, and then submit it.  However, you are still liable for breaches of copyright and so could be sued by the correct copyright holders and have to repay damages.  The basic rule of thumb is don&#39;t use copyright images, text, or music, and don&#39;t mimic other peoples ideas or intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Contacting a developer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If after reading all of the above you are pleased with your idea and want to get an iPhone developer on board, you will need to contact them with the following pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed explanation of your idea - if you are not comfortable with giving up your idea, then get the developer to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (or NDA) which will prevent them from stealing the idea.  It is worth pointing out to the developer that you have already done your research and know that your idea is unique before asking them to sign anything as you will be more likely to get a favourable response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you are looking for - you&#39;ll need to detail what you need the developer to do (e.g. build the app, suggest changes, recommend a designer, etc) and also if you are looking to pay outright for the code or enter into a profit-share agreement (and the potential terms of such an agreement).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reply to all emails that I receive but many developers will not get back to you if the two points above are not fulfilled.  The more detail you supply, the more likely it is that a developer will want to work with you and form a professional relationship as it shows that you are serious and have researched your idea rather than being someone interested in simply making a quick bit of cash by copying an existing flash game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this article has given you a quick insight into how you can make your ideas more appealing to an iPhone developer and answers some of the more common questions about the process. If you have further questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments below or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll be updating this article as and when other common questions come in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show/videos/challenge/apps-complete&quot;&gt;watch the Gadget Show episode online&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326303505&amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download Social Beacon from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was asked if I&#39;d like to appear on Channel Five&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show&quot;&gt;The Gadget Show&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to take part in a challenge about iPhone applications with Jason Bradbury and Suzi Perry.  I had only been developing iPhone apps for a short while but decided to enter into the spirit of the challenge by jumping head first into some of the trickier aspects of the iPhone SDK.  The show and results of the challenge &lt;a href=&quot;http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show/videos/challenge/apps-complete&quot;&gt;aired last night&lt;/a&gt; so I thought it was time for me to do a write up of the application and the process of building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Early Stages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day-to-day job involves me working as a freelance PHP developer but I&#39;m a huge Apple fan and have owned every iteration of the iPhone.  It wasn&#39;t long before I started toying with the idea of building iPhone apps, but the programming language was different to anything I&#39;d ever done before.  As a PHP developer, I found it very hard initially learning how to code in Objective-C (the coding language for iPhone apps).  However, I purchased a couple of books including the excellent &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pragprog.com/titles/amiphd/iphone-sdk-development&quot;&gt;iPhone SDK Development&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learn-Objective-C-Mac-Knaster-Dalrymple/dp/1430218150/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1255475410&amp;sr=1-3&quot;&gt;Learn Objective-C on the Mac&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and it wasn&#39;t too long before I became an iPhone developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making it on to the App Store with &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321813152&amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Magnetic Flux &amp; Metal Detector&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes Link], I was asked if I&#39;d be interested in making the iPhone Application for &quot;The Gadget Show&quot;.  The initial concept was fairly simple: an application that allowed you to quickly choose from a list of questions to build a sentence which could be sent to your social networks.  I agreed immediately and began working with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lizahayes.co.uk&quot;&gt;Liza Hayes&lt;/a&gt; on the design but hadn&#39;t realised exactly what I&#39;d let myself in for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to work as expected, the application would need to access an SQLite database on the device, be able to store custom sentences input by the user to that database, be able to build a sentence based on building an SQL query, and use the networking features of the iPhone to post to both Facebook and Twitter.  I had done a lot of work with Facebook Connect and the Twitter API in my web development work and I knew that Facebook had a custom integration of its API for the iPhone.  Even so, the networking problems were going to be tricky to overcome.  To add to all of this, Jason suggested that he&#39;d like a way to show off the accelerometer in the iPhone, and I was interested in the settings panes and how we could make the app easily customisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Developing the app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 3.0 OS had just been released, yet as a registered iPhone developer I was working on iPhone 3.1 so there were enumerable problems in switching my Xcode environment and devices back and forth between the two versions.  This was compounded with problems with Facebook Connect in that it had been written for the 2.1 OS and so was not 100% compatible with 3.0 leading to some caffeine fuelled Googling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had decided that the accelerometer could be used in what Jason called &quot;Fingerless Functionality&quot; whereby you could shake the phone left and right to navigate around the Social Beacon wheel, and then tip the phone up and down to progress backwards and forwards through the option.  A simple shake of the phone would be enough to regenerate a sentence.  These parts were all very straightforward (especially the shake, which can be detected with one line of code in OS 3.0) yet we came to a usability problem once we thought about sending the message.  We couldn&#39;t use the shake or the down gesture, as these were used for regenerating the sentence on the final screen, so we needed to find another fingerless input method to post the message.  The answer eventually came in the guise of the microphone: we could detect sound so that blowing into the mic would blow your message to the internet!  Of course, this meant learning yet another aspect of the SDK that I had previously left untouched -- Core Audio -- but I&#39;m always up for a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Distribution and the App Store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With various bugs overcome and a final test version working on my device, we were ready to distribute the app via the App Store.  You may have heard some of the horror stories from the App Store -- it can take a very long time and you end up being rejected without reason -- but I have to say that I found the process to work incredibly well.  It took 14 days from submission before Apple got back to us to say that the Application had been rejected due to a bug in the networking code (if you weren&#39;t connected to the internet the app would hang, or worse, say that the message had been sent).  They were incredibly helpful and gave a detailed explanation of the problem as well as including some sample code to show how the networking portion could be handled better.  After a couple of hours fixing it up, we resubmitted and the app was available around the world a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were of course competing against Suzi&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326437408&amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Biker Blast-Off!&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes Link]&quot; which was distributed at the same time, but crucially neither app was publicised on either Twitter or any other medium without mentioning the other with the same weight (so we&#39;d invite people to try both apps).  Within 3 days, Social Beacon was in the top 20 free social media applications whilst Biker Blast-Off was climbing up the overall free application charts worldwide and racking up a huge number of downloads.  Interestingly, as both of our apps climbed higher, the reviews became more negative and I realised that this was true of nearly every app in the store.  It seems that even if you are willing to give away a free product which could easily be charged for, people will still rip the idea to pieces (some comments on the game even saying &quot;you&#39;d need to pay me to play this game&quot; - no pleasing some people!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-13-at-22.26.33.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jason Bradbury and Ben Dodson&quot; title=&quot;Jason Bradbury and Ben Dodson&quot; width=&quot;511&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; class=&quot;featured&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show was aired last night (and is available to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show/videos/challenge/apps-complete&quot;&gt;watch online&lt;/a&gt;) and has the full story as well as the final figures and the winner of the challenge, but the story of the apps continues.  Since the show, both applications have now shot back up into the charts with both apps appearing in the top 10 free applications in the UK App Store.  Social Beacon is currently sitting pretty at spot number 4 and I couldn&#39;t be happier with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to the Gadget Show team (especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/colbyrne&quot;&gt;Colin Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ChrisPyUK&quot;&gt;Chris Payne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonbradbury.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Bradbury&lt;/a&gt;) and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lizahayes.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Liza Hayes&lt;/a&gt; for her fantastic design work.  It was a great experience and it looks like I&#39;m going to be developing iPhone applications for a long time to come!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gowalla Tools Web App: Find your missing Gowalla items!</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/10/07/gowalla-tools-web-app-find-your-missing-gowalla-items/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who play the excellent iPhone GPS game &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve built a handy web app that will allow you to see all of your missing items and where you can find them.  In addition to telling you what type of spot a particular item is likely to appear at, it will also list specific spots if applicable (such as states - some items only appear in Texas for instance) and allow you to use the built-in location awareness of Safari in iPhone 3.0 to show you where the nearest spots of that type are.  It is available today at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowallatools.com/&quot;&gt;http://gowallatools.com/&lt;/a&gt; and is the first in a series of small utilities I&#39;ll be creating to help players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/IMG_0189.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Login&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Login&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-303&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will see when you open the web app is a prompt for your Gowalla username.  You don&#39;t need to login to the service, but it does need to know your username so it can search through your pack effectively (although you can also see your friends&#39; missing items if you want to help them out with any of your own spare items).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/IMG_0188.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Missing Icons&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Missing Icons&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-306&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will then be shown all of your items in a list.  Tapping any of these (e.g. &quot;Conference Badge&quot;) will then show you which spots are likely to randomly give you the item in question when you check in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/IMG_0190.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Icons Appear At...&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Icons Appear At...&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-307&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list will sometimes be broken into two sections: spot categories where you have a chance of finding the item on check in, and internal categories or spots.  These internal categories are usually things such as states (e.g. &quot;Texas&quot; has quite a few items) or freebies (which I believe are items randomly dropped by devs) but are often actual spots (e.g. &quot;Alamofire&quot; - the offices of the developers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the standard categories, you can tap them to find spots in your local area (but you&#39;ll be prompted to allow the site to use your location - your location information isn&#39;t stored, it&#39;s just used to determine your nearest spots).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/IMG_0191.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Location Confirmation&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Location Confirmation&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-308&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/10/IMG_0192.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Nearest Spots&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla Tools - Nearest Spots&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-309&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are spots in your area, you can tap on them to view the spots information on the Gowalla website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you save the web app to your homescreen (press the &#39;+&#39; symbol in Safari and choose &quot;Save to Homescreen&quot;) then you&#39;ll get a pretty custom icon so it looks just like a normal iPhone app (which it may well become one day).  I&#39;ll be expanding the service offering as and when I find new things to include :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is in beta mode so there may be a few bugs and tweaks but if you have any feedback, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.  Happy Gowalla&#39;ing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Legal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web app is not owned, maintained, or developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://alamofire.com/&quot;&gt;Alamofire, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; - Gowalla and all other trademarks and imagery are copyright of Alamofire.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone 3GS: Review and Speed Test (vs. iPhone 3G)</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/06/19/iphone-3g-s-review-and-speed-test-vs-iphone-3g/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was up at 5:30am this morning in order to start queueing for the iPhone 3GS outside my local O2 store - I&#39;m happy to say that I was the first person in the queue and although I had problems in getting a second contract (eventually deciding to buy a PAYG version from the Apple Store) I am now the proud owner of the iPhone 3GS.  In this short post, I hope to review a few of the key features as well as giving you some real world stats from tests I&#39;ve run to show the differences between the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS.  Please use the comments section if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a title=&quot;iPhone 3GS vs iPhone 3G by Ben Dodson, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/3642559406/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3642559406_087a27f07c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 3GS vs iPhone 3G&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; class=&quot;featured&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Initial Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that the iPhone 3GS somehow felt nicer than the previous models of the iPhone.  I remember upgrading from the original to the 3G and thinking that the new plastic back made it feel more comfy and it seems that again something has been done to the texture to make it seem more solid and comfortable.  Although it looks exactly the same as the 3G, there are a few minor aesthetic details such as the lettering on the back now being the same colour as the Apple logo which makes it stand out a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;oleophobic screen coating&quot; (that&#39;s oil resistant to you and me) really does work incredibly well.  With previous iPhones, greasy finger marks on the screen wouldn&#39;t go away even if you rubbed them with your t-shirt or trouser leg; they just smeared.  With the new screen coating, one wipe with a t-shirt makes the screen look just like new.  This is a very useful addition to my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other detail I noticed straight away is that the screen is a lot brighter.  I had thought it was slightly better (in the same way that Snow Leopard is much clearer than Leopard although this is to do with a switch to the 2.2 gamma standard) but wasn&#39;t aware of how much better until I placed it next to my old iPhone 3G - you can see the difference in the photo above.  The key thing here is that both phones were set to the same brightness level so there really is an improvement in the hardware somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compass&lt;/strong&gt; - the new digital compass (or magnetometer if you prefer?) was one of the big talking points of the iPhone 3GS as it allows for far more accurate turn-by-turn navigation.  It also added a sexy new app appropriately named &quot;compass&quot;.  The compass app itself is fairly basic and I felt that the actual readings were quite slow to adjust.  Additionally, making a very small change to the orientation of the phone doesn&#39;t always reflect in the compass which is a little frustrating when you are trying to get it to point exactly North.  Having said that, it&#39;s good enough to get a basic idea of which way is which.  The real area the compass shines in is in the updated Maps application where pressing the location button re-orientates the map to the direction you are facing.  This is absolutely invaluable when navigating and is a feature I will be using heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice Control&lt;/strong&gt; - When it was announced at the WWDC Keynote, I felt that Phil Schiller sounded a bit stupid going on about how this great phone was now able to do voice commands seeing as it was something my Nokia could do 8 years ago.  However, I now realise why he was quite as smug as he was.  It really does work exactly as they demoed it.  After I synced my contacts and music, I tried a few of the commands such as &quot;phone Ben Dodson&quot; (to which it replied &quot;work, home, or mobile?&quot;), &quot;play panic at the disco&quot;, &quot;play more songs like this&quot;, and &quot;what song is this&quot;.  Every name and command I tried worked flawlessly so I was incredibly impressed.  The real power is that with other phones you&#39;d need to add a voice tag for each contact whereas with the iPhone, it just reads the text and interprets your voice accordingly so there is no need for you to record a voice command prior to using it.  The app looks awesome as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt; - The new camera app is fantastic.  I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s only a 3MP camera as the quality of the images is as good as some phones I&#39;ve seen with 5 or even 7MP.  The video app is simple to use (as you&#39;d expect) and again the quality is very very good.  It&#39;s a shame it doesn&#39;t film 720p but the colour balancing and overall quality make up for the relatively small resolution.  The only negative I can find is that video at nighttime is fairly grainy (whereas in daylight it&#39;s beautifully smooth) and the camera would really have benefited from having a flash.  I was really hoping the rumours that the Apple logo would act as a flash light were true but it appears that it&#39;s not the case... for this model at least!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I&#39;ve got the need, the need for speed!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for buying the iPhone 3GS is that I wanted faster app loading times and generally quicker responses within the apps.  Playing Sonic the Hedgehog on my 3G nearly bought me to tears as it was actually unplayable (I&#39;m sure they only tested it on a 2nd generation iPod Touch...) and I&#39;d always get frustrated playing Tap Tap Revenge 2 when the app would skip a little due to memory running out.  So, speed was a big thing I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not imagine it would be as good as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed increases I&#39;ve noticed so far have been nothing short of phenomenal for something that got a 50% speed boost and a doubling of RAM.  Quite often, load times have been reduced by up to 4x and overall app reliability is nothing short of flawless.  Here are a few stats based on some of my most commonly used and intensive apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bejeweled 2 - app launch to menu screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 12.1s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 3.7s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iDracula - selecting &quot;grave park - survival&quot; on menu to actual gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 21.6s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 6.5s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peggle - app launch to &quot;touch to play&quot; message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 25.4s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 10.2s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog - app launch to &quot;SEEEGGAAAAA&quot; message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 5.9s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 2.7s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tap Tap Revenge 2 - app launch to main menu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 6.4s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 3.3s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tap Tap Revenge 2 - selecting &quot;The Sound of Settling&quot; on &quot;Hard&quot; to start of track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3G = 8.9s&lt;br&gt;
3GS = 3.5s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All apps were tested on the 3.0 OS after an iPhone restart.  They were timed using a stopwatch and each test was run 3 times and then averaged in order to minimise discrepancies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed boost was definitely the biggest thing for me and I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations.  The small range of stats above don&#39;t accurately display how snappy everything has become.  Previously, navigating the menus of Tap Tap Revenge 2 always a pause of around a second between each screen whereas now it&#39;s instant.  Also, actually playing the game could be incredibly frustrating as I knew I was in time but a memory glitch along the way would cause the tappers to move erratically causing you to miss them even though you hit the area at the right time.  This was verified to me when playing on the 3GS as I got a 100% streak straight away without really trying too hard.  Another game that suffered horribly on the 3G was Sonic the Hedgehog which really shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to go on the App Store.  It was probably ok on the 2nd Gen iPod Touch as that had a slightly faster CPU, but on the 3G it was just dismal with stuttering sound, obvious slow down and speed up, and a whole host of other glitches such as unresponsive controls.  On the 3GS, it plays exactly as it always should have done - exactly the same as it did on the Mega Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t even touched upon areas such as the speed increases in Safari rendering (pages are near instant - truly amazing mobile web browsing), the noticeably smoother animations between apps, or any of the other minor tweaks that make sure that the 3GS not only outperforms the 3G, but actually completely exceeds the speeds that were previously attainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are one or two problems in all of this.  For me, the biggest question mark hangs over how the App Store is going to be managed.  The iPhone 3GS has much better hardware and allows for much better graphics which means that theoretically we should get into a situation where apps are available only for 3GS.  However, it looks as if Apple is going to resist this route and that the 3GS upgrade is purely for across the board speed increases rather than in making more powerful apps.  I can&#39;t predict what is going to happen but I fear that there will be a lot of apps made that will only work on the 3GS but they won&#39;t be labelled as such in the App Store (in the same way that Sonic the Hedgehog should have been labelled 2nd Gen iPod Touch only).  This leads to a lot of frustration when you are paying £5.99 or so for a game which then won&#39;t work on the existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, do I think the 3GS is worth the upgrade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Yes I do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the iPhone 3GS was announced in the Apple WWDC Keynote last week, the internet has been ablaze with criticism about both AT&amp;T and O2 with regards to their upgrade policies to the new phone for existing iPhone 3G customers.  I have battled long and hard on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.o2.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=3&quot;&gt;O2 Forums&lt;/a&gt; to try and put across that they have in fact done nothing wrong, it is the public that are misguided, yet this has fallen on relatively deaf ears.  I decided it would be easier to put one whole post together about the &quot;O2 Fail&quot; (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23o2fail&quot;&gt;#o2fail&lt;/a&gt; for you Tweeters) and the rational response to it so I could just point people in this direction rather than re-explaining myself over and over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#39;t work for O2 and never have done.  I used to be on the 3 mobile network in the UK as it was the cheapest before switching to O2 in order to get the iPhone.  I bought the original iPhone about 4 months before the 3G came out (and so paid full price for it which was around £330 plus a £35 contract) and then upgraded to the iPhone 3G by paying £59 and upgrading to the £45 18-month contract.  I will be buying the iPhone 3GS next Friday by taking out a second contract and letting the remaining 6 months on my current contract run out.  Therefore, I have no reason to be supporting O2 as I would benefit greatly if they caved in and let people upgrade for free - the point I&#39;m putting across is that there is good reason why they aren&#39;t doing that and people need to understand why that is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/06/o2failtwitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Fail Twitter&quot; title=&quot;O2 Fail Twitter&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-168&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The iPhone 3GS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href=&quot;http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0906paowdnv/event/index.html?internal=ijalrmacu&quot;&gt;WWDC Keynote&lt;/a&gt;, Apple announced that the new model of the iPhone (the iPhone 3GS - the &#39;S&#39; stands for &#39;Speed&#39;) would be released on the 19th of June in 6 countries at a price of $199 for the 16GB model and $299 for the 32GB model.  Crucially, these were prices on a specific AT&amp;T 24-month tariff for new customers.  Here in the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.o2.co.uk/update/paymonth.html&quot;&gt;the prices vary&lt;/a&gt; from &#39;free&#39; to £280 or so (or even £550 if you choose Pay As You Go).  Again these prices are for new customers only.  So, as was bound to be the case, there are a large number of iPhone 3G customers who want to upgrade to the iPhone 3GS who are being told they have to finish their existing contracts before they can get the new model.  This can be done in two ways; wait until your contract ends or pay to get out of it now.  This very simple issue is the basis for all of &quot;O2 Fail&quot; comments over the past few days.  Let&#39;s look at why it has annoyed people so much...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;But last time...&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the iPhone 3G as announced, O2 allowed original iPhone customers to terminate their contracts early at no cost and start a brand new contract.  The only cost was that of the phone and was the same cost that applied to new customers.  In my own case, this was around £59 as I moved up to the £45 a month contract (18 months).  The reason O2 did this (when they and other carriers have never done this for a phone before) is because they didn&#39;t subsidise the original iPhone.  When you went to the Apple Store or to an O2 store, you paid the full retail price (which was around £330 for the 16GB model).  Therefore, the contract you were on was purely making money based on calltime - that was a pretty sweet deal for O2 and so it was surprising they allowed people to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, most people seem to think that as it happened last time it should happen this time.  They have failed to grasp the crucial word &#39;subsidy&#39;.  The original iPhone wasn&#39;t subsidised, the iPhone 3G was (as is the iPhone 3GS). This means that a large portion of the money you now pay to O2 from your contract goes directly to Apple for the cost of the phone.  It&#39;s worth pointing out that this is the same with every other phone on the market with every other carrier (unless you&#39;re using Pay As You Go in which case you pay the full price for the phone up front).  So, if O2 were to say at this point &quot;of course you can upgrade under the same conditions as last time&quot; they would lose a HUGE amount of money as not only would they not have made any money on airtime, they would have lost the money on the subsidised phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What about paying off the remaining subsidy on my phone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a fair number of people asking this question - &quot;why can&#39;t I just buy out my subsidy and get a new contract&quot;.  The key problem here is that O2 would still not have made any money as they would have basically given you free airtime for the last 12 months.  If you only pay your subsidised part, then they aren&#39;t making money.  This is where the crucial word &#39;contract&#39; comes into use as you signed an agreement to pay a certain amount of money per month to cover the cost of the phone and the airtime.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;But what about customer loyalty!?!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The follow up argument to the above is &quot;but they&#39;d make money on the airtime in my new contact&quot;.  So, you&#39;ve just screwed O2 for the past 12 months by using their network without effectively paying for it and now you want a new contract where they will be able to make their money back?  I don&#39;t follow that for one instant as what happens when the next iPhone comes out in 12 months ?  We&#39;ll go back to square one with the argument being &quot;they did it the last 2 times, why can&#39;t I upgrade now&quot; which means that again O2 will go without being paid for their network usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ok, how about they just add my remaining contract to my new contract?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly harder argument as in a way it makes some sense.  Rather than waiting 6 months for my contract to expire and then upgrading to a new 18 month contract, why can&#39;t O2 just let me upgrade now and add an additional 6 months to my new contract?  This would work in theory but the problem is that you&#39;ll start getting people on contracts from 18-36 months and I&#39;ll guarantee that come next year they&#39;ll be the first ones to ask for another extension putting them on 24-42 month contracts and so on.  This is a similar problem to people extending loan terms forever and ever in that there comes a point where they simply aren&#39;t going to pay it back.  I don&#39;t know the full details but I imagine there are some laws on how many times a contract can be extended as well in order to ensure fair fiscal management but don&#39;t quote me on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&#39;t they realise we&#39;re in the middle of a recession!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the best argument I&#39;ve seen used - people actually pointing out that due to the &quot;credit crunch&quot;, O2 should be lowering prices so they can get the phone cheaper.  If the recession is really that bad, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little stupid of you to be arguing about getting a slightly faster iPhone?  Surely you should be worrying about the price of basic essentials like food, clothes, and petrol rather than the ability to get a slightly better camera in your smart phone?  And how do you think mobile phone carriers are doing in the economic crisis?  They need to make money as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Facebook Group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my other favourite things during this whole saga has been the Facebook group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=90662329515&amp;ref=nf&quot;&gt;I DONT WANT TO PAY TO UPGRADE MY IPHONE!&lt;/a&gt; - I don&#39;t think I even need to provide an argument against this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spoken about the reasons why these arguments are flawed but my real point is that people don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; the iPhone 3GS so I don&#39;t understand why so many people are desperate to upgrade.  I&#39;m an iPhone developer and therefore want the new hardware so that I can write better apps that utilize it&#39;s hardware, but to everybody else there is very little gain.  Sure you get a slightly better camera, the ability to film video, and a digital compass (as well as a processor and RAM upgrade) but you get far more from the 3.0 upgrade than you do from the hardware upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose my real point is that there are things called &quot;contracts&quot; that people have entered into - they are now throwing their toys out of the pram because they can&#39;t get the latest shiny object from Apple without paying for it but unfortunately that&#39;s just how it is and O2 are not going to change their minds.  Why not?  Because if they did they would lose huge amounts of money.  At this point people decry the greedy networks and the fact that they are going to take their business elsewhere.  The crucial point is that O2 is the only network that can cope with the iPhone properly and they are the only supplier so you either stay with them or you get a Palm Pre, a Google Android, or one of the new Windows Mobile phones from another supplier.  But, I can guarantee that in 12 months when a new model of those phones comes out, the networks won&#39;t let you upgrade early for free so you&#39;ll be back where you started.... just with a rubbish phone instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key point is that the iPhone 3GS has not been designed for existing iPhone 3G customers - it has been designed specifically to address the concerns of people who were deciding whether to get one of the other smartphones I mentioned or an iPhone.  They have added MMS, Video, and a better camera - the three major flaws with the iPhone that any undecided customer would count as negatives.  If you&#39;re an iPhone 3G user at present, I highly doubt that you are going to stop becoming an iPhone user over this issue as you have already been sold on the idea of the phone and you know that no other phone currently suits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, as a network O2 has proved itself to be far better than many other iPhone carriers (*cough* AT&amp;T *cough*).  They are supporting MMS on launch day (including video for those with the 3GS), the push notification system has worked flawlessly so far (I&#39;ve been beta testing it), and they have internet tethering working as well (which also works very well - I&#39;ll be coming back to the price of this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What can I do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&#39;re read this and been swayed over to rational thinking rather than getting involved in the anti-O2 hype, what are your options for upgrading to the iPhone 3GS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait.&lt;/strong&gt; I know it&#39;s difficult but you don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the iPhone 3GS.  If you had a great need for video then you would have bought a different phone in the first place.  If you bought your iPhone 3G on launch day, you should have 6 months of you contract left and this may be reduced to 0 months, 3 months, or 5 months depending on how much you&#39;ve spent recently - take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.o2blueroom.co.uk/o2prioritylist/&quot;&gt;O2 Priority List&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy a Pay As You Go iPhone 3GS and sell your old iPhone 3G on eBay (or to a friend, etc).&lt;/strong&gt;  You get the full functionality, get to keep your number, and it&#39;ll all work on launch day just by putting your existing SIM card into the new phone.  Visual Voicemail, etc, will work as you&#39;ll still be on a contract plan (the hardware between the contract and PAYG phones is the same).  Plus you might even make money this way as the iPhone 3G&#39;s are selling for a high price - best to get on their quickly though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay off your existing contract.&lt;/strong&gt;  This route is the most expensive but you could pay off your existing contract and take out a new one - the price is generally the number of months remaining times your monthly rate so in my case it was £270 (£45 x 6).  This is the easiest way but the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take out a second contract.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is what I&#39;m going to be doing next Friday.  Rather than paying off my contract in one lump sum, I&#39;ll keep that contract and my iPhone 3G (I use it for app testing) but I&#39;ll just get a new contract with the iPhone 3GS.  This means I&#39;ll be paying for 2 contracts for around 6 months but that spreads the cost a bit rather than having one big hit all at once.  Also, you can downgrade your iPhone contract one level after 9 months so I&#39;ll be able to move my iPhone 3G down to the £35 plan this month (and the £30 the month after) which will save some money - it also means I have a spare, live phone in case I need it for anything.  This is again an expensive method but it spreads the cost rather than having it all in one hit - however, it may be subject to a second credit check to make sure you can afford two contracts at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What should O2 do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this whole saga could have been avoided if O2 still offered 12 month contracts.  Of course, the main problem is that phones are getting more and more expensive and operators want to keep overall contract prices as low as possible so they look competitive.  I believe it was 3 mobile who were the first to bring in 18 month contracts as they could do so incredibly cheaply - they got a huge market share simply because people didn&#39;t realise what they were signing up for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on the one hand you could have 12 month contracts but charge people a large amount a month so you cover both subsidy and airtime, or you can have 18-24 month contracts which are cheaper but then the customer has to pay out if they want to upgrade to the latest and greatest phone.  Both have their issues and overall the cost is probably the same; the real difference is when you pay it.  Personally, I would like to see mobile operators offer all three services so people can choose straight up if they want 12 months (high price, low lock-in), 18 months (medium price, medium lock-in), or 24 months (low price, high lock-in).  That would avert this whole discussion on upgrading to new phone models!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it - O2 haven&#39;t done anything wrong, they are simply doing the same as every other provider has done since they were created.  We can shout all we like but they won&#39;t back down on this issue as it doesn&#39;t make any financial sense for them to do so.  If you are desperate for the iPhone 3GS, then you&#39;ll just have to pay for it or wait it out a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if I&#39;ve convinced you to stop petitioning O2 about iPhone 3GS upgrades, perhaps I can convince you instead to spend your time petitioning them about their ridiculous Internet Tethering charges as that is a fight I believe can be won - £15 for 3GB of transfer is far, far too much and I can&#39;t see any justification for it!  So, give up the 3GS battle and instead shout about the tethering charges :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/06/11/mastering-phpmyadmin-3-1-for-effective-mysql-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked by Packt Publishing to review a copy of their latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-phpmyadmin-3-1-fourth-edition/book/mid/210509nwgp84&quot;&gt;Mastering phpMyAdmin 3.1&lt;/a&gt; which promises to &quot;increase your MySQL productivity and control by discovering the real power of phpMyAdmin 3.1&quot;.  I was a little skeptical at first of a book on phpMyAdmin, the most widely used MySQL admin tool, especially when it arrived at 325 pages! However, there is a huge amount of information that really is very useful to every PHP developer out there whether you are a beginner or an advanced user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/3606999757/&quot; title=&quot;[123/365] Mastering phpMyAdmin 3.1 by Ben Dodson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3606999757_83df2cf84f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;[123/365] Mastering phpMyAdmin 3.1&quot; class=&quot;featured&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, most people I&#39;ve mentioned the book to have scoffed and said something along the lines of &quot;I already know how to use phpMyAdmin&quot;.  Like them, I thought I knew what phpMyAdmin was and what it could do but it turns out there are huge amounts of functionality I never knew existed in MySQL let alone in phpMyAdmin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For the Beginner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts off with a very gradual introduction to phpMyAdmin covering everything from basic installation and setup to a detailed explanation of the overall interface.  I was particularly pleased to see an in-depth chapter on security configuration at the beginning of the book which would help any newcomer make sure that their setup is completely secure - usually such chapters are found at the back in the appendices!  The first six chapters follow in a similar vein with very basic information about how to run SQL queries, edit data, change structures, and so on but chapters seven and eight deal with exporting and importing data which is one of the many areas that I have seen developers struggle with in the past.  There is a good explanation of the different methods for importing / exporting including the benefits of certain types over others.  Crucially, there is a section on CSV using LOAD DATA which is something that has always seemed to lack proper explanation to me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There then follows a few more chapters which more advanced users can probably skip such as searching, an overview of relational databases, and table / database operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advanced Topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that the real meat of the book for experienced PHP developers begins at chapter thirteen  with each further chapter adding useful knowledge.  I&#39;ve listed the key highlights of these chapters below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Multi-Table Query Generator&lt;/strong&gt; - A powerful tool which enables you to fine tune complex queries via a series of forms thus allowing you to specify multiple criteria.  It contains features such as automatic joins which allow you to very easily build up complex queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/strong&gt; - A feature I was completely unaware of that allows you to save queries for future use.  This is particularly useful if you happen to be a database administrator that administers purely on a table by table basis within phpMyAdmin and has a number of queries to run.  I always used to have popular queries I&#39;d use stored in a notepad on my OS X Dashboard but no need anymore!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently had a need to produce some MySQL documentation so was very happy to read this chapter and find out about the excellent documentation tools available within phpMyAdmin.  This includes not only a basic print view, but also a data dictionary and a relational schema which are all exported as PDFs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIME-Based Transformations&lt;/strong&gt; - If you&#39;re the kind of developer that likes to store images, etc, as BLOB fields.  With transformations, you can make images appear as images within the phpMyAdmin results rather than as indecipherable encoded text.  Very useful!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MySQL 5.0 and 5.1&lt;/strong&gt; - a quick look at the enhancements that MySQL 5 added with things such as views, routines, stored procedures, and very interestingly, triggers (a way to run other MySQL commands when a certain thing happens - e.g. when a table gets updated).  You&#39;d probably want a separate book to cover MySQL 5 if you were planning on doing any development with it, but this chapter gives you a good overview of some of the things you can expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MySQL Server Administration&lt;/strong&gt; - The final chapter deals with some of the more fundamental maintenance tasks related to the actual server and improvements that can be made with caching etc as well as a good comparison of the different types of storage engine you can choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I would highly recommend this book to any PHP developer or anybody that is using phpMyAdmin on a regular basis.  It could really have been broken into two books - a beginners and an advanced - but it works well by acting as a reference for those developers that have grown up using phpMyAdmin.  The main thing though is that it taught me a great deal about phpMyAdmin that I didn&#39;t realise was even there - just goes to show that even a basic sounding book can have a great deal to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mastering phpMyAdmin 3.1 is available online from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-phpmyadmin-3-1-fourth-edition/book/mid/210509nwgp84&quot;&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, there have been a number of web apps that have popped up with the task of feeding your ego (or indeed deflating it) by telling you exactly who is following you on Twitter and giving you pretty graphs to show you how your followers are increasing - some of them even go so far as to estimate how many followers you are likely to have in a weeks time!  However, the key thing for me that is missing from Twitter is the ability to see who has stopped following you and also those people that stopped but are now following you again as you don&#39;t get email alerts from Twitter for these two things.  This is a useful piece of information to have as it will let you know when people drop off and whether they are important (e.g. friends who don&#39;t care what you are talking about thus suggesting you should stop talking crap) or not (e.g. spam bots).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research and the only real web app to fulfill this need that I could find was the beautifully designed &lt;a href=&quot;http://useqwitter.com/&quot;&gt;Qwitter&lt;/a&gt;.  However, the problem with Qwitter is that it only gives you the details for one person with the idea being that you say &quot;tell me when this username stops following me&quot; - it&#39;s a little bit stalkerish in my opinion!  Like any PHP developer, I decided that I could build my own little system to give me my Twitter ego boost and so have come up with the class below which you can all now take and use as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out I was wrong about Qwitter as the username you put in to follow is supposed to be yours, not the person you want to watch when they leave you.  They need to do better copywriting! In any case, the class below serves as a good demo of the public Twitter data and allows you to extend it the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This won&#39;t work straight out of the box - I&#39;ve put in a few comments which say &quot;SQL Required&quot;.  This is because you may well have your own schema (although I do provide one) and you may have your own framework or DB connection functions (I know I do).  Once you&#39;ve done those, just substitute the constants for your own details and it should all work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TwitterFollowers.class.php&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;/**&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt; * Crawls Twitter Followers and sends an email alert to show you who has started following, stopped following, and started re-following&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;MySQL Database Schema&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TwitterFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ENGINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MyISAM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CHARSET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;latin1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you will need to substitute the SQL sections for your own particular schema and database functions.  Once you&#39;ve done that, alter the class constants so that they are your own username and the email address you want to send your updates to.  Finally, set up a CRON job so that it runs at a certain point every day.  I currently have mine set to run at 9am every morning but I may well change it to run every time I post a tweet as then I&#39;d be able to see which tweet had made people start or stop following me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script works by checking the publicly accessible JSON feed of your followers and getting all of their IDs.  I say it&#39;s publicly accessible, but I don&#39;t think it is if you have protected your updates which will of course cause problems!  Once it has all of the IDs, it checks this against the IDs stored in your database - if there aren&#39;t any then everyone will show up as following you on the first run.  If it finds an ID in your database that isn&#39;t in your JSON string then you&#39;ve been dumped!  Conversely, if it finds an ID in the JSON string but not in the DB then, congratulations, you&#39;ve got a new follower.  The final instance is if it finds an ID in the JSON string that is in the DB but has an end datetime assigned to it.  This means the person was following you, stopped, and has now decided to re-follow you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole lot then gets packaged up and emailed to you with each section broken down so you can read it clearly.  In order to do this, it looks up each ID that goes into the email against that persons publicly available Twitter information to give you both their &quot;real name&quot; and &quot;username&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Known Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t think it will work if you have your updates set to hidden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one of your followers gets banned from Twitter, then their name won&#39;t show up in the email (it will just be blank)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This script won&#39;t work if you have more than 5000 followers - this is because that is the maximum result set from the JSON string.  You&#39;d need to add paging information to get more than 5000 although this would be fairly easily.  Alas I don&#39;t have that many followers to be able to test that out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you can easily (if you know PHP) get updates on all your Twitter followers and non-followers.  Feel free to use all the above code and modify to your hearts content - if you found it to be useful, then please leave a comment below.  Oh, and I couldn&#39;t possibly write a post about Twitter without reminding you that you can follow me &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;@bendodson&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/12/getting-xbox-live-achievements-with-php-part-1-the-problems/&quot;&gt;first of this series of tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on how to extract Xbox Live achievement data using PHP and AppleScript, I thought I would use this second part to look at the AppleScript that powers one side of the system I&#39;ve put together.  In the next part, I&#39;ll be explaining the PHP class I&#39;ve built, and in the fourth part (the last of the series) I&#39;ll be showing you how the two talk together and how you can use the collected data with other APIs such as Facebook Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s have a look at some code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;XboxLive AppleScript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://externals.bendodson.com/weblog/XboxLive/urls.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;server:XboxLive:data.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open for access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;permission&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set eof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;window.location.reload()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open for access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;permission&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;eof&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&#39;ve used AppleScript for anything other than just playing around and I have to say that as a language it&#39;s incredibly good.  Just by reading through the above, you&#39;ll probably be able to work out what&#39;s going on even if you&#39;ve never seen any type of programming code in the past.  Even so, I&#39;ll go through each section and explain what it does along with the reasons why I decided to do it in this particular way rather than some of the other ways I could have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; All of this AppleScript is completely self-taught from searching around on the internet.  I was going to buy the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/AppleScript-Missing-Manual-Adam-Goldstein/dp/0596008503/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1242776373&amp;sr=11-1&quot;&gt;AppleScript: The Missing Manual&lt;/a&gt; but I was able to read all the sections I needed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=-ynfWvkwzpwC&quot;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt; which was convenient - I&#39;ll probably buy the book anyway to brush up on a few other areas.  If you are an AppleScript guru and you know a way to optimize my code, please use the comments section below so others can learn and so I can update it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get on to looking at the code, it might be worth briefly recapping how everything will work.  My server will check the XboxLive API in order to see if my gamerscore has increased.  If it has, then it saves the URL of the achievements page for my most recently played game (which it can&#39;t itself read due you needing to login to Xbox Live with javascript enabled - something cURL can&#39;t do!) in a text file on the server.  My mac mini at home then runs the above AppleScript in order to retrieve the saved URL, open it in Safari, and save the HTML in it&#39;s own text file that is available via the internet.  My server will then check this text file, parse the HTML, and save the achievements to a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How does it all work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&#39;ve got that out of the way, let&#39;s look at that AppleScript in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://externals.bendodson.com/weblog/XboxLive/urls.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;server:XboxLive:data.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three lines of code are used to define variables which we will use later on in the code.  The first one, &lt;code&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/code&gt;, is the URL of the text file on my server that will tell our script what URL we need to retrieve the HTML from.  You&#39;ll see how we populate that text file with my XboxLive php class which will be discussed in part three of this four part series.  The second variable, &lt;code&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/code&gt;, is interesting as it contains the path to the file we are going to save the HTML to on the local machine.  So why the strange syntax?  This is referred to as Finder syntax and is a way for AppleScript to reference a particular section within Finder, in this case a text file.  It is essentially the same as &quot;/server/XboxLive/data.txt&quot; which we could have used - the difference is that we would have had to have converted that into the Finder syntax in order to use some of the file editing commands we&#39;ll use later so I thought it best just to save it correctly at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open for access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;permission&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set eof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three lines are again fairly easy to follow.  We set a variable of &lt;code&gt;dataFile&lt;/code&gt; to be the handler of the file declared in the path of &lt;code&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that we have specifically mentioned we want to use write permissions as the default is just to use read permissions.  The next line sets the eof or &quot;end of file&quot; within the handler to 0 whilst the following line tidies up by closing the file handler (which isn&#39;t strictly necessary but good practice).  The reason for setting &lt;code&gt;eof&lt;/code&gt; to 0 is that we want to delete the contents of the file before we put anything else in later.  This is practical for the simple reason that we don&#39;t want our PHP script on the server to parse a load of data in the text file (or even download it) if it&#39;s something it has already read as that would be a waste of processing power and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;window.location.reload()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the first real section of the code that deals with our problem.  In these lines, the application Safari is made to open the text file on the server that may contain the URLs, refresh that page using JavaScript, and then attempt to set the variable &lt;code&gt;toCrawl&lt;/code&gt; to the text of the file.  Before we even examine this in depth, you may be wondering something along the lines of &quot;why don&#39;t you download the file or read it with FTP rather than opening it in Safari&quot; and this would be sensible.  My initial thoughts on how to get the text on the server into a variable in my AppleScript was to access the file via FTP.  OS X has very basic FTP support (read only unfortunately) that can be mounted through Finder and then accessed using the Finder syntax we used earlier on.  I had originally written some AppleScript that would run in the startup process of the mac mini which would mount the drive.  Then, this AppleScript read the file in using &lt;code&gt;open for access file urlFilePath&lt;/code&gt; and set the variable that way.  It all worked perfectly until the server changed the contents of the URL text file.  No matter what I did, the text file came back the same as it had when first fetched and it was that that I realised that the FTP built into Finder is fundamentally flawed as everything is cached.  If you don&#39;t edit the file through Finder (e.g. by using a mac application that saves it again through Finder) then it will never know it&#39;s updated and thus can&#39;t be used in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let&#39;s look at my workaround.  The first and last lines are the opening and closing of a &lt;code&gt;tell&lt;/code&gt;; a way to get an application to do what we want.  In this instance we are going to tell Safari to open the URL saved in the variable &lt;code&gt;urlFilePath&lt;/code&gt; and then delay for one second.  This delay is needed as Safari may take this long to open the URL.  Without the delay, we may be in danger of running code on a page that hasn&#39;t loaded.  In the next line, we tell JavaScript to reload the document before waiting another second for this to complete.  This refresh is necessary to clear any caching of the document.  The final section is used to set the variable &lt;code&gt;toCrawl&lt;/code&gt; to the contents of the browser window.  You may wonder why there is a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; statement wrapped around it?  This is because if the text file was empty and you tried to get &lt;code&gt;the text of the front document&lt;/code&gt;, the script would error.  To get around that, we initially set the variable (in the very first block of code if you remember?) and then use &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; to reset the variable only if no error would be caused in doing so.  Very useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this block of code, we will have a variable which will either contain a URL if the text file on the server had one, or it will be empty, meaning that the server is not requesting any HTML.  Let&#39;s move on to the next section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;toCrawl&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open for access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;permission&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;eof&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dataFile&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the core piece of functionality that I was trying to achieve all in this block of 11 lines.  This script will open a URL in Safari, and then save the source code of the loaded page in a text file.  You&#39;ll notice that the first and last lines are an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement relating to the length of the &lt;code&gt;toCrawl&lt;/code&gt; variable.  I don&#39;t unlock achievements every 5 minutes of the day and so, more often than not, the &lt;code&gt;toCrawl&lt;/code&gt; variable will be empty.  If it is, then we want to completely ignore the next section of code as there is no reason whatsoever to run it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next line is a one line &lt;code&gt;tell&lt;/code&gt; to make Safari open the URL we saved which is then followed by a 15 second delay.  You&#39;ll notice this is a lot longer than the 1 second delays earlier.  The reason for this is that, in the first case, it was a simple text file with around 100 characters in it and so loaded incredibly quickly.  This URL, conversely, will be a very large page (around the 100kb mark) that may go through a series of 5 redirects depending on how recently the page was accessed.  This is because after 15 minutes of inactivity, the site forces you back to the login page but I have a cookie stored that will then automatically log me back in.  It just takes a few seconds to go through the process of all the redirects to get to the actual page hence the long time delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section is a simple expansion of the code we used at the beginning.  We tell Safari to set a variable of &lt;code&gt;sourceCode&lt;/code&gt; to be the source of the page that&#39;s open - we also tell it to be forced as a string in case there are any casting issues.  Next, we open the &lt;code&gt;dataFilePath&lt;/code&gt; and set a handler of &lt;code&gt;dataFile&lt;/code&gt; so that we can then write the &lt;code&gt;sourceCode&lt;/code&gt; variable into the file starting at the end of the file (which we all know is masquerading as the beginning of the file also as we set it earlier on... keep up!) before tidying up after ourselves and closing access to the handler.  Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Safari&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very final line of code, we tell Safari to close all of it&#39;s windows in preparation for the next iteration.  This may not seem terribly important, but trust me, if you neglect to put it in and then unlock 10 achievements, you&#39;ll find your mac now has 20 open Safari windows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s all there is to this section - a large chunk of AppleScript and a rationale as to why I had to open Safari to get at a text document rather than doing it a slightly more simple way via FTP (due to massive caching issues).  I hope this post has introduced some of you to AppleScript which I have found to be a rather powerful tool when it comes to mac development.  It&#39;s very easy to understand and is a great way of transitioning from a web-based language to a desktop-based one especially as you can save AppleScript as a standard mac application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me again for part three of this four part series when I&#39;ll be looking at this from the other angle; the PHP server that needs to parse the HTML we have gathered using this AppleScript.

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/18/iphone-30-push-notification-testing-with-ap-news/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a member of the iPhone Developer Network, I received an email from Apple today inviting me to &quot;test the Apple Push Notification service&quot; by downloading a new version of the Associated Press app.  They&#39;d given me a special code to use in iTunes that would redeem into a download of the app but unfortunately the code only works in the US Store.  Furthermore, trying to switch to the US Store didn&#39;t work as my account is tied to the UK Store.  I was going to give up but then I had an idea on how to get around this problem.  Here&#39;s how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Creating a new account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use the &quot;redeem&quot; section of iTunes, you type in your code and if you&#39;re not logged in already it prompts you to.  However, you can also register at this stage so I decided to set myself up a nice new US account.  You have to link a credit card or payment method to your account and I initially tried to do this but it blocked me as the payment method wasn&#39;t based in the US (either using a credit card or paypal).  However, as I was redeeming a code, they have to give you the option of registering without a credit card as it might be you&#39;ve given a $25 gift card to your nephew or something like that.  Therefore, all I had to do was choose &quot;no payment method&quot; and then fill out the rest of the form.  Email was easy as I run my own domain so just created a dummy email account, and faking an address is made very easy thanks to reverse geocoding.  I simply went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://getlatlon.com/&quot;&gt;getlatlon.com&lt;/a&gt;, picked a random place in Florida, and then used a reverse geo-coding app to convert that lat lon into a street address.  Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the account was created, my code was automatically redeemed and the app downloaded to my machine.  It synced across to my iPhone with no problems and is now running happily.  I&#39;ve attached some screenshots below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/05/img_0011.png&quot; alt=&quot;Settings&quot; title=&quot;Settings&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/05/img_0012.png&quot; alt=&quot;Notification Settings&quot; title=&quot;Notification Settings&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/05/img_0013.png&quot; alt=&quot;AP News Notification Settings&quot; title=&quot;AP News Notification Settings&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, the app triggers a new &quot;notifications&quot; panel where you can enable or disable individual apps and the alerts that they are allowed to send you.  I haven&#39;t yet received any notifications but will update photos and any additional functionality as and when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Just received my first push notification!  I remember during the last Apple Keynote (the launch of the 3.0 beta) that the reason push hadn&#39;t been introduced before is because it&#39;s a complex system that has to be set up differently for every mobile provider.  After an hour with no updates, I had begun to think that O2 wasn&#39;t set up but it would appear that they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/05/img_0014.png&quot; alt=&quot;AP News Push Notification&quot; title=&quot;AP News Push Notification&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Technically, this should fall under the iPhone Developer NDA.  However, ever since iPhone Beta 3.0 was released to the development community, every Mac blog has published photos and detailed information without any kind of reproach from Apple so I feel that there is no problem in publishing these photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Duplicate Messages Bug Fixed on TubeUpdates.com</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/17/duplicate-messages-bug-fixed-on-tubeupdatescom/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2009 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/17/duplicate-messages-bug-fixed-on-tubeupdatescom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, I run a website called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;TubeUpdates.com&lt;/a&gt; which provides a RESTful API for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk&quot;&gt;TFL Underground&lt;/a&gt; network so you can build apps that utilize that data.  Unlike some other services or XML files that try to provide this data, my API scrapes all of the pages on the TFL site in order to give out the specific messages for each line e.g. rather than having &quot;Minor Delays&quot; you&#39;ll be given an array of each message from their site about the delays such as &quot;Sunday 17 May, suspended between Liverpool Street and Leytonstone. Two rail replacement bus services operate.&quot; which is obviously a lot more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as my script relies on screen scraping, problems do occur when TFL decide to change their HTML or site structure which has happened recently.  Previously, every tube line had it&#39;s own page with it&#39;s messages listed on it but now there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/livetravelnews/realtime/tube/default.html&quot;&gt;one single page&lt;/a&gt; with all of them shown and hidden with javascript.  This meant that for a short period, my API was posting out the messages for every single line with each line returned (so if you wanted to look at circle line messages, you would in fact get every line).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has now been fixed and actually makes the service slightly better for me as it now means I can crawl just 3 pages rather than the 14 I was crawling before (thus better for both bandwidth and CPU cycles).  I have a number of functions set up to report when TFL change their site structure as the usual problem is that a site redesign changes class names or markup in such a way that the API just breaks.  However, in this case none of these warnings kicked in as it was getting the data correctly and all seemed to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a big thank you to those of you that emailed in to report the bug!  If you have any questions about the Tube Updates API, then please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;check out the site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;drop me an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Xbox Live Achievements Data: Part 1 - The PHP Problems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you with an Xbox 360 (or indeed some &quot;Games for Windows&quot; titles) will know all to well about the achievements system prevalent in every game.  For those that don&#39;t know, every gamer has a profile which has a gamerscore.  This score goes up by completing certain tasks within each game as laid down by the developer.  This could be something you would do anyway such as &quot;finish the game&quot; or something random such as &quot;destory 10 cars in 10 seconds&quot;.  Every full game can give out 1000 gamerpoints (1250 with expansion packs) and an Xbox Arcade title can give out 200.  These points are somewhat of a geek badge of honour for most Xbox gamers who will try and do everything to get the full 1000 in each of their games - there are also those that want to increase the number as quickly as possible so you can find numerous guides online for the easiest way to get 1000 points (it seems Avatar is still the best way giving you the full 1000 with about 3 minutes of gameplay!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was trying to compete with my ex-boss over the number of gamerpoints we each had (I lost by the way), I found that there was no public API from Microsoft to allow you to get at the Xbox Live data.  There was however an internal API and one Microsoft associate had set up a restful API so that you could publicly call the internal one.  This worked well enough for the basic site I put together to compare two gamerscores but I&#39;ve been wanting to do more with the API for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overall idea is that I&#39;ll be able to type in my userid and then have my server poll Xbox Live at a certain time and then update my Facebook Wall when I unlock new achievements.  The message would be something along the lines of &quot;Ben just completed the &#39;Fuzz Off&#39; achievement in Banjo Kazooie: N&amp;B and earned 20G&quot; and would have the correct 32x32px image for the achievement.  I initially thought that this would be fairly easy but I was unfortunately very wrong!  In this series, I&#39;m going to show you the problems I encountered as well as the final (rather complex) workaround I&#39;m creating in order to get it all to work!  If you&#39;ve got any questions, please leave a comment or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Attempt #1: Using the API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first sat down to work on this project, my initial thoughts were &quot;I can just reuse the public API I used for my gamerscore comparison site - there&#39;s bound to be an achievement section in the returned data&quot;.  After eagerly re-downloading all the code, I discovered that although there was some achievement data, it was nowhere near as detailed as the information that I would need.  The problem was that the API only shows you your recently played games and how many achievements you have unlocked in each one as well as the overall number of points you have earned for that game.  Theoretically, I could check the API every few minutes and compare the number of points with a local copy in order to work out when a new achievement had been unlocked but I&#39;d only be able to say that an achievement had been unlocked in a certain game worth a number of points.  To make things even trickier, if I unlocked more than one achievement within the timeframe of the API check, then the results would be wrong (e.g. it might say I&#39;d unlocked one achievement worth 45G when in fact I&#39;d done two; one for 20G and one for 25G).  This would become even more complex if I unlocked an achievement, then switched games and unlocked one in that game before the API had been called.  In short, the public API, useful though it can be, was not going to work for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Attempt #2: Screen Scraping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we move to option two; screen scraping.  This is the process of getting the server to request pages from a website as if it were a browser and then just ripping the content out of the HTML.  It&#39;s messier than an API as it relies on the websites HTML not changing and it&#39;s also a lot more processor intensive (as you&#39;re parsing an entire XHTML page - possibly marked up invalidly - rather than a nice small XML or JSON file).  I&#39;ve done lots of screen scraping in the past, both for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;Tube Updates API&lt;/a&gt; and for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://packrattools.com/tracker/&quot;&gt;Packrat Market Tracker&lt;/a&gt; (a tracking system for a Facebook game), so I didn&#39;t think it would be too much hassle.  But then I hadn&#39;t banked on Microsoft...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hurdle is that although my Xbox Live data is set to be shown publicly, you still have to be logged in with a Windows Live account to view it.  This is annoying because it means my script is going to have to log in to Windows Live in order to get the HTML of my achievements listings.  The second hurdle is that there is no single page listing my latest unlocked achievements - the main profile page shows my last played game (and it&#39;s last unlocked achievements) but that&#39;s no good as they are not in order and it might be that I&#39;ve switched games after unlocking something so the last achievement on the profile page may not be the last achievement I&#39;ve unlocked.  This isn&#39;t such a big problem as there are pages for each game so I&#39;ll just have to crawl each of my recently played games pages and get the achievements on each one but it&#39;s slightly more hassle than having one page of latest achievements (as it means I have to make several requests thus increasing bandwidth and script run time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logging In to Windows Live&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, logging into a site is quite easy using cURL.  You need to work out where the form is posting to, put all of the data to be posted in an array, and then make a cURL request that sends that array to that URL.  You will also need to enable both a cookie file and a cookie jar (a basic text file that is used for all of the cookies during the requests) as you will probably only want to login once and then have each future request know that you are already logged in as this will save on overall requests per execution of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows Live login, on the other hand, is an entirely different kettle of fish!  The URL you are posting to changes on each request as do the variables that you are posting.  This means we need to make a request to the login page first of all and extract all of the data from the hidden input fields as well as the action attribute of the form.  We can then go about posting that data (along with our email address and password) to the URL we just extracted.  This POST goes through a HTTPS connection though, so we need to modify our cURL request further in order to ensure that SSL certificates are just accepted without question.  Our overall cURL request, with all of these options, will look roughly like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// set up cURL request - the $url would be the action URL that you&amp;#39;re POSTing to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// make sure the script follows all redirects and sets each one as the referer of the next request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_HEADER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ssl options - don&amp;#39;t verify each certificate, just accept it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// fake the user-agent so the site thinks we are a browser, in this case Safari 3.2.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_USERAGENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// tell cURL to use a text file for all cookies used in the request - $cookie should be a path to a txt file with 755 permissions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// post options - the data that is going to be sent to the server.  $post should be an array with key=&amp;gt;var pairs of each piece to be sent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$postfields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;urlencode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$postfields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// make the request and save the result as $response - then close the request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had thought that this would be the end of it and that the returned data would be the first page after logging into Windows Live.  Instead, I got nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  No matter what settings I tinkered with or parts of the code I changed, it was just returning blank.  It was then that I noticed the rather unpleasant JavaScript files on the page and some suspicious &amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt; code at the top of the page.  If you load the login page without JavaScript in a normal browser, then the code in the &amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt; section gets read which has a meta redirect to send you to a page telling you that you must have JavaScript enabled!  I hadn&#39;t noticed this previously as my cURL request doesn&#39;t understand HTML, it was just returning it as a big lump so I was able to get all of the variables, etc, out without being redirected as I would be in a normal browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t think too much of this as obviously the page worked without JavaScript - it must just be a rudimentary way to make people upgrade their browser (although it didn&#39;t actually give you any advice - very bad usability!).  But no, the login does require JavaScript as when you submit the form a huge amount of obfuscated code does some crazy code-fu to the POST request and encrypts it all before sending thus making JavaScript a requirement to log in to Windows Live.  To my mind, this has obviously been done to prevent people from screen scraping their sites such as Hotmail but it really is a pain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The AppleScript Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about 3am by the time I&#39;d realised that screen scraping wasn&#39;t going to work and I&#39;d been playing with the code for around 5-6 hours so was pretty annoyed with it.  So today I sat down and listed all of the obstacles so I could work out a way round them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data from the API wasn&#39;t good enough so couldn&#39;t be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I could screen scrape the Xbox Live profile page / game pages, I couldn&#39;t get to them as needed to be logged in to Windows Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&#39;t log in to Windows Live without JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing this down and having a think, I realised that I have a static IP address and a mac mini which is always turned on and connected to the internet.  I also realised that all my server needed to parse the Xbox Live pages was the HTML itself - it didn&#39;t necessarily have to come from a cURL request or even from my server.  After this &#39;mini&#39; enlightenment I set about writing a plan that would allow me to get around the Windows Live login using a combination of a server running some PHP and cURL requests and a mac mini running some AppleScript.  It will work roughly like this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server will store a record of all of my game achievements in a MySQL database.  It will therefore know my gamerscore and be able to compare it to the gamerscore found using the API.  Every five minutes it will check this and if it notices a difference in the numbers, it will know that I have earned an achievement and thus needs the HTML that alluded me yesterday.  It knows the URL it needs so it will log this in a text file on the server that will be publicly available via a URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Mac Mini will use AppleScript to check the URL list on the server every five minutes.  If it finds a URL, it knows that the server needs some HTML so it will oblige by loading the URL in Safari (which will be set to be permanently logged in to Windows Live thanks to authenticating and choosing &quot;save my email address and password&quot; which stores a cookie) and then getting the source of the page and dumping it in a text file on the Mac Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text file on the Mac Mini (with the HTML we need) will be available to my server thanks to my Static IP and so when the next CRON job on the server runs, it will see that it wanted some HTML (based on their being some URLs in its own text file) and so will check the text file on the Mac Mini and thus get the HTML it needs.  It can then parse this, work out the new achievements and log them in the database accordingly.  It will then clear the URL list (so that the mac mini doesn&#39;t try and do an update when it doesn&#39;t need to) and then continue on it&#39;s cycle by checking if the gamerscore is equal to the (now updated) database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Next Step&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after a failed evenings development, I have now come up with a solid plan to get around several key hurdles.  I&#39;ll be posting part two of this series shortly once I have built the application and it will have all of the source code included for those of you that want to replicate a similar system.  In the mean time, I hope this post will show you that problems do pop up in application development and that they can be resolved easily by writing out a list of each hurdle before formulating a plan to get around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Part two of this tutorial is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/19/getting-xbox-live-achievements-data-part-2-the-applescript-solution/&quot;&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/05/08/designing-for-the-social-web/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/londonwebstandards/&quot;&gt;London Web Standards Meetup&lt;/a&gt; where we discussed the book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Social-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321534921&quot;&gt;Designing for the Social Web&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by Joshua Porter.  The organiser of the event, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/otrops&quot;&gt;Jeff Van Campen&lt;/a&gt;, very kindly managed to get a couple of the books for us for free on the basis that we wrote up a review of the book on our respective blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendodson/3394810309/&quot; title=&quot;[54/365] Designing for the Social Web by Ben Dodson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3588/3394810309_19db8a7dbb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;[54/365] Designing for the Social Web&quot; class=&quot;featured&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I found the book to be very good although it was rather simple and basically consisted of a similar message to the excellent book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t Make Me Think&lt;/a&gt; by Steve Krug - that is to say, &quot;use some common sense&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is broken down into 8 chapters with each one becoming slightly shorter and slightly more off topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. The Rise of the Social Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opening chapter really sets the scene by explaining what is meant by the term &quot;social web&quot; and investigating the move from one-way communication to two-way and then many-way communication.  Joshua also looks at something he calls &quot;The Amazon Effect&quot;; the behavioural trait that people will quite often use Amazon for product research even if they have no intention of purchasing there.  He also investigates something that I come across more and more these days; &quot;The Paradox of Choice&quot;.  This is a term given to the problem of having so much choice in front of us that in the end we actually do nothing as we spend all of our time comparing.  Whilst not offering any solutions to this problem, it is worth noting that it is present in order to stop the more content happy of us trying to offer every single solution to a user when oftentimes it&#39;s better just to give them one or two - this again enforces the idea of keeping things simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter goes on to look at how &quot;social software is accelerating&quot; and how at some point the entire internet will be taken over by the social movement.  I have a few issues with the figures bandied about at this point (and indeed in many other similar books).  The most frequently used statistic is from Technorati in that there are &quot;120,000 blogs being added every day&quot; thus somehow showing that the very face of the internet is changing.  To my mind, this is nonsense as for every new blog being added to the blogosphere, there are probably a good few that are just fading into non-existent as their owners fail to update them or their accounts get closed down.  Whilst I do appreciate that the take up of social media is indeed growing, it is nowhere near the levels that people would have us believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. A Framework for Social Web Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another excellent chapter that focuses on the bane of all agency-bound developers; feature creep.  This is one of the key problems in current web application development as people think that more features means more users and thus a better application.  This is of course completely wrong and many would do well to remember the old maxim &quot;quality not quantity&quot;.  Joshua looks at a wide range of social network sites such as YouTube, Digg, Delicious, Twitter, etc, in order to point out what their key function is and therefore highlight that the most successful social apps are those that stick to what they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a rather peculiar section regarding giving social objects a URL.  Apparently, Flickr was initially a flash application and it wasn&#39;t until people had their own page to show off their photos that Flickr really began to grow.  The issue here is that a lot of emphasis is placed on having a URL and that this is the main reason that Flickr grew whereas in actual fact it was just the idea that somebody could have their own profile page and their core model went away from flash application to a real web application that probably increased their user base.  I&#39;m not contending that social objects should have their own URL but rather that this is fairly obvious and that it probably wasn&#39;t the defining feature that turned Flickr around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Authentic Conversations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the point in the book that I began to notice that it was slipping away from it&#39;s titled purpose of &quot;design&quot; and instead looking at very general good business practice.  The entire contents of this chapter can be summarised by &quot;respect your customers and talk to them&quot;.  There is quite a large section about the &quot;Dell Hell&quot; situation from 2005 and how Dell had basically received complaints and not responded to them.  To make it worse, a blogger created a website to publicise this and they still came back and said nothing giving them a very bad image.  Joshua&#39;s dichotomy of this is to show an incident in which the technical editor of the book posted a message on her blog about a problem she had experienced with Plaxo and that they had then commented on her blog to try and help resolve her problem.  In it&#39;s way, it is a good example as it shows a company commenting on an issue on somebody elses blog in order to correct them.  What isn&#39;t pointed out is that the original poster should have just contacted their help desk (or in fact read the instructions in the first place) rather than writing a rant on her blog which the company had to find and then correct her.  However, this is probably very realistic of most online conversations as there is always a group of people (especially prevelant on YouTube comments) who will just shout loudly when anything changes.  This is exemplified later in Chapter 5 with Facebook.  In my opinion, the response from Plaxo wasn&#39;t particularly good either as it was far too formal a response (felt a bit auto-generated) and they had performed some rudimentary anti-spam protection on their email address (listing it as &quot;privacy @t plaxo.com&quot; rather than just putting &quot;privacy@plaxo.com&quot;).  If the person complaining couldn&#39;t read the simple instructions on the task she was performing or search for the technical support when she had a problem, it is probably fairly likely that she&#39;ll just copy and paste what is there and then write a follow up article entitled &quot;They never reply to my emails - they just send bounces!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter does move into a few interesting articles of PR situations that have gone very wrong such as Dreamhost calling an overcharge to their customers of $7.5million a &quot;teensy eensy weensy little billing error&quot; and a good section on how to apologise correctly.  However, this isn&#39;t dealing with design and isn&#39;t what I expected to find inside this book.  It&#39;s welcome advise but I would consider it to fall under &quot;common sense&quot; or some sort of management category rather than the encompassing role of &quot;design&quot; as the title suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Design for Sign-up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get back to intended idea of the book (&quot;design&quot;) and approach how to get people over the all important hurdle of signing up to your website.  I particularly like this section as it reinforces one of the first eye-opening pieces of knowledge I received about writing copy for the web; keep it very short and very simple.  This method was taught to me many years ago as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will write copy for the web as if they were writing for a broadsheet newspaper such as The Times or The Telegraph whereas it should be written as if for a tabloid such as The Sun or The Daily Mirror.  Notice how tabloids tend to &lt;strong&gt;highlight key phrases&lt;/strong&gt; and keep sentences short.  The first thing you should do with any copy you write for the internet is delete 50% of it.  Then, once you think it&#39;s the right size, remove another 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obviously doesn&#39;t apply to articles or blog posts but is a key tactic for writing easily digestible content for homepages or sign up forms.  This chapter espouses this view by forcing people to state very clearly who, what, where, when, why, and how.  With these key questions in mind, you can make your inviting text all the more succinct and likely to generate conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other half of this chapter details how to &quot;reduce sign-up friction&quot; which basically boils down to making your registration form as small as possible.  One thing that is missing here which should definitely have been mentioned is the removal of captcha forms and human readable tests.  There is no reason at all why companies should still be using these ridiculously outdated methods of spam prevention.  They are inaccessible (I have trouble reading a large number of them) and time consuming yet more to the point they are completely useless as a spam bot can be fooled easily by simply having a hidden field named something enticing like &quot;email&quot; and then have your script check to see if it&#39;s full.  If it is, you&#39;ll know it was a spam bot as there is no way for a human to fill it in.  To prevent humans submitting applications over and over, use an automated system such as Akismet (which I use for spam prevention on this blog) or just impose an IP limit so you can&#39;t have more than one registration from the same address every 15 minutes.  This will slow down spammers enough that they won&#39;t bother but won&#39;t interfere too much with those on shared networks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Design for Ongoing Participation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another good chapter as it focuses a lot on the psychology of users and essentially on the mass insecurity they have and the need for them to be able to create their own little home on your site.  Any social network these days has to have a profile page and again I find it strange that this needs reiterating as this is surely a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are one or two good points made about encouraging efficacy (a way of giving active users a boost in reputation) and in giving people solid control over privacy options (something that Facebook neglected initially to the general outcry of the public) but these things really are fairly obvious to anybody intent on creating a social network. I think this chapter could have offered a bit more constructive advice and maybe a few more case studies of sites doing the right and wrong things in order to make it as good as some of the previous chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Design for the Collective Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collective Intelligence is a term used to describe how social applications can be shaped by the users of the system in order to make it work as they would like it and promote content that they would like to use.  This is highlighted by the real world example of Digg which obviously works based on the idea of collaboration and in voting on particular pieces of content to move them up and down the social chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an excellent section on &quot;leverage points&quot; which goes into detail on how your social application will have many points at which the users can control something and how this can be managed correctly e.g. how a homepage of content voted on by users is displayed, what happens when somebody votes, etc. but I would contend that this is all fairly obvious to anybody who has used a social application before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Design for Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing on the internet has supposedly boomed with the invent of networks such as StumbleUpon, Delicious, and Digg yet I am a firm believer that social network badges and sharing forms don&#39;t actually get used by the majority of users.  This is also true of RSS feeds as I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/does-anybody-really-use-rss-feeds/&quot;&gt;mentioned in a previous blog posting&lt;/a&gt; as these are still mainly the domain of geekier users of the net. It is true that most websites around at the moment have these social badges or sharing forms but I don&#39;t think it is true of most social applications that people are going to be building.  If you look at the title of the book, you are almost expecting to be taught how to make the next Delicious, not on how to integrate it.  There are few social networks that have badges for other social networks on them as they are all very precious about their own traffic (although this has changed to a certain degree with Facebook Connect).  This chapter is focusing on entirely the wrong angle as most social apps don&#39;t make sharing easy - blogs certainly do, but apps don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one part that interested me was the criticism of too many social network badges which has become a phenomenon of the growth of social networks.  As there are so many to choose from, how do you keep all your bases covered?  More and more blogs are moving over to systems such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/&quot;&gt;AddThis&lt;/a&gt; which do show all of the badges in a hidden button overlay but again this is still rather clunky and doesn&#39;t generate much conversion as people are overwhelmed by choice (as discussed in Chapter One).  Having said that, I have written a jQuery plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.bendodson.com/weblog/jtardis/&quot; title=&quot;Access browser history with JavaScript&quot;&gt;jTardis&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to show only social networks that the user subscribes to thanks to some javascript trickery but I&#39;ll be blogging on this in more detail in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that frustrated me about this chapter was the fact that the sharing forms that Joshua had designed and used as good examples were in fact really bad!  All of the examples look like they had fallen out of the pre-dot com era of web design and didn&#39;t really show the basic simplicity of sending a page to someone else.  He does note that most people tend to copy and paste the URL and just email.  However, writing a form or widget to do this is not difficult yet he seems to have not done it particularly well - I&#39;m sure there are better examples he could have used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;8. The Funnel Analysis&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final chapter is one that to my mind is far too short and doesn&#39;t really have a place in this book at all.  It is a chapter designed to show how you can monitor the statistics of your social network via funnel analysis - a basic way of monitoring where people drop off from your site (e.g. are they falling at registration signup or at registration confirmation?).  This is all very well and good but the chapter is far too short when you consider there are books of many hundreds of pages that still only scratch the surface of site analytics.  There are also numbers used to show what small percentages of people actually sign up to certain sites but these are totally irrelevant as the apps involved aren&#39;t mentioned and every app is different so your figures could be differ greatly.  They may as well have been made up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found this chapter to be a little strange as I read the final sentence about how funnel analysis helps to illustrate that people do drop off as they progress through the site, and then turned the page to immediately drop off... into the index.  The book was over with no summary, no recapping of the key points (remember the &quot;writing for a tabloid&quot; I &lt;strong&gt;highlighted&lt;/strong&gt; earlier?).   There was just a feeling of &quot;oh, it&#39;s finished&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the book is fairly good and does highlight a few interesting ideas.  However it strays far too much from it&#39;s key focus of &quot;designing for the social web&quot; and thus fails to meet one of the key things it espouses; keeping your application simple by basing it around a single piece of functionality.  The book was supposed to be about design and specifically on how to build great social web apps, yet too often the conversation moved to general business ideas such as &quot;talk to your customers&quot; or looking at how to analyse your web stats when it should instead have focused on the key components in a social app and how they work.  To an extent this does happen (particularly in chapter 4) yet I don&#39;t feel it happened enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t used a great many social applications and are interested in a broad overview rather than a detailed analysis of the social web, then this book might be worth the £28.99 list price.  However, if you are looking to build the next great web app and are already an avid user of the social web, then this is probably one you can afford to miss as it will just be covering well-trodden ground.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poor Usability on the Web - Part 1: Online Banking</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/04/28/poor-usability-on-the-web-part-1-online-banking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I get frustrated really easily on the internet when I come across something that doesn&#39;t work intuitively.  It seems that the majority of people are desensitised to the various hurdles of thought on both the internet and computers in general (e.g. pressing &quot;Start&quot; in windows to get to the &quot;Shut Down&quot; option) yet more and more I find myself getting annoyed that people can&#39;t get the most basic things right on the internet.  Now that I&#39;m working as a web consultant, I&#39;m hoping to be able to get a lot of clients to just look at the systems and sites they have created and apply a bit more common sense to them in the way popularised by the excellent &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Usability-Circle-Com/dp/0789723107&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t Make Me Think&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by Steve Krug.  This is a view extended by Joshua Porter&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Social-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321534921&quot;&gt;Designing for the Social Web&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (which I shall be reviewing here shortly) although that is geared slightly more towards customer service and social networks than the all encompassing issue of usability and best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for my first real post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;my new website&lt;/a&gt; I thought I&#39;d perform a basic usability study of the online banking system from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rbs.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;; a website that frustrates me every time I want to check my bank balance online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/04/homepage-1024x718.png&quot; alt=&quot;The RBS Homepage&quot; title=&quot;RBS Homepage&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-62&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/safari/&quot;&gt;Safari 4 Beta&lt;/a&gt; on a MacBook for the purpose of this demonstration and wanted to demonstrate that the RBS homepage (above) loads absolutely fine in this configuration.  However, as soon as you click on the &quot;Log In&quot; button on the right hand side, you get this page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/04/unsupported-640x449.png&quot; alt=&quot;Unsupported browser on RBS Digital Banking&quot; title=&quot;RBS Unsupported Browser&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-71&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the unsupported browser thing isn&#39;t a problem for me as Safari 4 has a very useful &#39;Develop&#39; menu in the toolbar that lets me choose a different user-agent so I can pretend it&#39;s Safari 3.2.1 (which I&#39;ll do shortly to let me into the banking).  What does annoy me is that there is no reason for them to detect your browser as the site isn&#39;t any different depending on your browser.  At the very least, if the browser isn&#39;t supported (for some sort of CSS hacking rules perhaps?) it should load up a plain text version rather than just lock you out completely.  It really adds insult to injury seeing as by changing the user-agent, the site works absolutely fine.  Now I&#39;m not suggesting that they should be updating their site every time a new browser comes out to avoid this message.  On the contrary, I&#39;m suggesting that they should completely abolish the specific browser sniffing and just detect browsers (by functionality rather than name) which definitely don&#39;t work (e.g. IE 5.5 or Netscape 4) and offer them a textual fallback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other usability problems with this page include a &quot;Log Out&quot; button when you haven&#39;t logged in yet, and a &quot;Restart Log In&quot; button which just reloads the page.  On the plus side, they do have a link to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rbs.co.uk/personal/online-banking.ashx&quot;&gt;Information on supported browsers&lt;/a&gt;&quot; but this rapidly turns to a negative as there is absolutely no information there at all on supported browsers - the problem isn&#39;t even acknowledged!  At the very least there should be a list of supported browsers with links so you can upgrade, etc, but to have a link which goes to no meaningful information is just ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if we happen to be using a supported browser (or if we spoof our user-agent as I have to do), then we&#39;ll move on to the next page; the first stage of actually logging in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/04/login-640x449.png&quot; alt=&quot;RBS Login: Entering your customer number&quot; title=&quot;RBS Login&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-75&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this page in itself isn&#39;t too bad.  Yes you have to enter a 10 digit number decided by the bank rather than an email address or an easy-to-remember username and it&#39;s only one field when it could in fact have been added to the previous page (e.g. enter number and then begin log in as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/HSBCINTEGRATION/CAM10;jsessionid=0000jNdUUpybSyihihLj-yc9J_m:11j71ffl3?IDV_URL=hsbc.MyHSBC_pib&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/a&gt; does it) but compared to the other pages it&#39;s fairly acceptable.  The only thing I would change is minimising the amount of text and enlarging the &#39;Next&#39; button - it doesn&#39;t need to be small and hidden away at the bottom of the page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now come on to my favourite page; security clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/04/security-640x449.png&quot; alt=&quot;RBS Login: Entering security details&quot; title=&quot;RBS Login Security Page&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-78&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this page is where all notion of web standards, accessibility, and best practice fall apart.  Before I begin, I would like to say that I understand fully the need to break up a security number and only enter certain digits for authorisation - it&#39;s obviously to stop anything like keyloggers or people watching you type as they&#39;ll only get a portion of the password and the next time you come to login you&#39;ll be asked to enter a different part.  I don&#39;t have a problem with that.  I do, however, have a problem with being asked to enter parts of my password in a completely random order.  Is there any particular reason why I have to enter 1st digit, 4th digit, then 2nd digit?  It makes every attempt a brain-teaser in itself as I have to conciously remember the security code, count up the number of digits, and then do it twice more to work out the order.  More often than not I&#39;ll be saying it under my breath in order to keep it in my fairly poor short-term memory so anybody near me would get the code anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it even worse, once you&#39;ve typed a digit, some javascript runs that automatically moves your cursor to the next input box.  I have never liked this convention as it falls against best practice and expected behaviour.  Nobody expects it to automatically move you to the next box as there are few websites that do it - it&#39;s not the default action on input forms.  The only time I have ever been able to see an acceptable use for this is when entering in a product key or something similar e.g. a long (over 20 characters) string of randomly generated text that has been broken apart into smaller chunks of 4 or 5 to make it easier for humans to transcribe.  That is the only situation that people expect the behaviour as it is the only place that the majority will have seen it happen before (although one could argue that my description of a product key could equally apply to a telephone number and I wouldn&#39;t dispute that).  However, for a single digit number that is masked by an asterix, it is completely unneccessary and confusing.  The part that really gets me though is that if you mistype, you can&#39;t tab back and delete it as you&#39;ll be automatically moved forward to the next input.  You either have to press &lt;kbd&gt;shift + tab&lt;/kbd&gt; and then &lt;kbd&gt;backspace&lt;/kbd&gt; incredibly quickly or disable javascript.  I&#39;m quite quick on a keyboard thanks to a lifetime of being sat behind one but I can imagine that this is incredibly frustrating for a user who doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on or is a little slower at typing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of slow typers or disabled users, we come to the &quot;Users with Special Needs&quot; section.  This seems to have been bolted on to the end of the login process almost as an afterthought or simple nod to the fact that people may have accessibility issues preventing them from accessing the system.  Rather than disabling the javascript or making the buttons bigger, the &quot;Users with Special Needs&quot; checkbox simply serves to disable the automatic refreshing of the page when the security timer expires.  Like most online services of a secure nature, the website will lock you out if you&#39;re inactive for a certain period of time.  In the case of the RBS banking system, this is done with JavaScript and you are physically kicked out of the system rather than getting an error when you navigate to a page after the timeout.  I&#39;ve no idea why disabling this feature falls under &quot;special needs&quot; but there we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you managed to decipher your password, enter it correctly first time, and scrolled down and squinted to find the next button, you will move to your welcome screen where you can get the basic overview of your accounts, right?  Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally a screen will appear with something in capitals along the lines of *WARNING* WATCH OUT FOR PHISHING ATTACKS - WE DON&#39;T EMAIL YOU.  I don&#39;t really mind these as they don&#39;t happen all of the time and it&#39;s good to know that the bank is trying to protect it&#39;s customers by reminding them of common sense.  It does have a ridiculously small &#39;next&#39; button under-the-fold (similar to the other pages) but it&#39;s not a regular occurrence so not a major gripe for me.  This next screen which does show up every time is though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://bendodson.s3.amazonaws.com/old-weblog/2009/04/final-628x600.png&quot; alt=&quot;RBS Login: The confirmation page&quot; title=&quot;RBS Login Final Page&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-82&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page has been designed for the sole purpose of getting people to keep their information up to date as well as advertising new products / services.  There is absolutely no benefit to the user as far as I can tell.  If we look at the first part, it tells the user when they last logged in, part of their address, and their email address.  Knowing when you last logged in might be useful as that way you can see if someone else has logged in than wasn&#39;t you - however, in reality most people don&#39;t remember exactly when they last logged in and I would assume that the vast majority of people don&#39;t even read that sentence.  The address section is completely redundant as it only shows a small section and again people are unlikely to read it.  If you move house, you are quite obviously going to change your bank details and I don&#39;t think a reminder every time you log in to your internet banking is necessary.  The final section about your email address is again redundant as the bank never emails it&#39;s customers.  Why?  There are too many phishing attacks in this day and age so the majority of emails from banks look like spam!  Besides, what are they going to email you?  Probably just adverts for other services such as advanced bank accounts and mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything below-the-fold (including the next button again!) is just advertising space.  In this screenshot, they are advertising paperless billing (which you probably already know about if you&#39;re using online banking) and the misleading &quot;Even safer online banking&quot; which is advertising for it&#39;s free security suite which basically tells you that you&#39;re connected to the banks website and not another website.  It only works on 32-bit windows running either IE or Firefox and won&#39;t work with screen readers.  Whilst this &#39;advertising&#39; is inevitable, it does not need to be shown every time the user logs in especially not on the confirmation of login page!  It&#39;s also ironic that they choose to advertise their free software to make you more secure after you&#39;ve logged in rather than at the start of the journey (where they do mention it but in much smaller writing rather than the large banner ad they use here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have clicked the next button, you are finally taken into the online banking system and you can get on with whatever task you need to perform such as checking your balance or making a payment (which requires an external card reader and a whole lot of hassle, but that&#39;s a rant for another day!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve tried to point out above, there are numerous accessibility and usability problems in the above scenario of logging into a mainstream online banking system.  As a brief recount, I need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake my user-agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type in my 10-digit &#39;customer number&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out random digits from both a security number and password (in a random order)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occassionally see a notices page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View a reminder of my last login, part of my address, and email address as well as bank service advertising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally get to my online banking overview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That weighs in at an astonishing &lt;strong&gt;6 pages&lt;/strong&gt; just to login to my account!  That doesn&#39;t include going back to the start if you happen to mistype some of the details or if you get trapped in the &quot;ever advancing javascript inputs of doom&quot; (patent pending).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several basic steps that RBS can take to rectify the process of logging onto their online banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they need to remove the browser sniffing and instead take up the practice of graceful degradation, that is to say show the best way of doing it and then fall back to more simple methods if the browser is too old.  There is no good reason why the latest browsers (which are by virtue more secure) should not be allowed access to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the javascript &#39;enhancements&#39; need to be completely removed not only due to accessibility concerns but also because they break traditional UI design and user expectation.  This goes for both the self-advancing input boxes and the automatic logout - you shouldn&#39;t need to tick a box to say that you don&#39;t want to be redirected from a site with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the entire process can be minimised down to 2 pages.  This is done by adding the &#39;customer number&#39; input next to the initial &#39;Log In&#39; box on the RBS homepage, and then having a single page to have both the two security checks (no random ordering of input boxes please!) and details of their antivirus package.  Once you&#39;ve passed security, you should be taken to the overview page where you can then at the top of the page have a small section about when you last logged in and then use sidebars for advertising of services such as &#39;paperless billing&#39; or reminding customers to keep their address details up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these three simple steps, the headaches for all customers can be removed, and the process would become easy-to-use rather than a constant struggle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d be interested to know of anyone&#39;s views on accessibility and usability with regards to online banking systems - please use the comments box below or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.  You can also let me know if there are any particular sites that have glaring usability issues that you&#39;d like me to investigate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>London Underground Tube Updates API is live!</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2009/04/26/london-underground-tube-updates-api-is-live/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/03/16/rss-feed-of-the-london-underground-tube-status/&quot;&gt;posted an article&lt;/a&gt; just over a year ago about an RSS feed of the London Underground Tube Status that I&#39;d created by scraping the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;TFL website&lt;/a&gt;.  I was overwhelmed not only by the response via comments and emails, but also by the sheer number of people using it (my apache access logs increased by 7GB per month!) that I decided to make a full blown API so that it would be easier for developers like me to create great mashups using data that should always have been publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy to announce that after a good test run at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rewiredstate.org/&quot;&gt;Rewired State&lt;/a&gt; event a couple of weeks ago, the Tube Updates API is now live and ready to be used at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot; title=&quot;An API for TFL London Underground Tube Update data&quot;&gt;tubeupdates.com/&lt;/a&gt; - You can request updates from any line (including the Docklands Light Railway) in either JSON or XML format and everything is structured to give you as much information as possible e.g. station closures, why there are &#39;minor delays&#39;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s not all!  I am caching the data (and have been since 1st Jan 2009) so you can also go back in time and look at the underground system at any point in time!  I wrote a rather rudimentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/stats/&quot;&gt;stats analyser&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://rewiredstate.org/projects/tfl-statistics&quot;&gt;Rewired State project&lt;/a&gt; which shows you the basic reliability over the past couple of months but that is just a taster of what you can do with the information now available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be releasing new versions of the RSS feed shortly so that non-developer types can still access the data - I&#39;ll be announcing those &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson/&quot;&gt;my twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; once they are ready in the next few days.  In the mean time, please play around with the API.  There are no real usage terms but I&#39;d love to know how you are using it so please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you make use of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those that come to this site regularly, you may have noticed that it&#39;s undergone a major overhaul!  I&#39;ve done a complete redesign (looks best in Safari) and replaced the blog engine with Wordpress so I should be blogging a lot more frequently.  I&#39;m also about to become a full time freelance PHP developer and web consultant but I&#39;ll be posting more details about that soon!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a large number of emails over the last week or so about my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/03/16/rss-feed-of-the-london-underground-tube-status/&quot;&gt;RSS Feed that displays the latest updates from the London Underground&lt;/a&gt; asking for more data or for a slightly different service.  I hadn&#39;t realised how many people were using the feed (which I put up as a tutorial on how to site scrape and to demonstrate the lack of tools on the new TFL site) until my server nearly died as the access logs had ballooned to 7GB!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m pleased to say that I&#39;m working on some major updates which will provide not only the current RSS feed but also a full REST API and dedicated site so you can get more data and more flexibility into your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have everything ready in the next few days so sign up to my &lt;a href=&quot;/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; to be notified when the new service goes live!  If you have any suggestions, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone 2.1 Firmware Update Released - Fast? Stable? Fixed?</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/09/14/iphone-2-1-firmware-update-released-fast-stable-fixed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/09/14/iphone-2-1-firmware-update-released-fast-stable-fixed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the firmware that all iPhone users have been waiting for has finally arrived. Even before it&amp;#x27;s announcement at &lt;a href=&quot;http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0809dt4bs89/event/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Apple&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s Rock&amp;quot; event&lt;/a&gt;, speculation was rife about what would be included. Many people wanted new features such as copy &amp;amp; paste and MMS support (it&amp;#x27;s never going to happen!) whereas others be-cried the fact that their beloved iPhone just didn&amp;#x27;t work that well due to app crashes, slow typing, and painfully long backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Steve Jobs finally announced that firmware 2.1 would be with us on Friday 12th September and would be a bug-fix only release. He claimed that the phone would be faster, backup time would be &amp;quot;dramatically reduced&amp;quot;, would have a &amp;quot;decrease in call set-up failures and call drops&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;faster installation of 3rd party applications&amp;quot;, would fix a lot of app crashing bugs, and would have &amp;quot;improved performance in text messaging&amp;quot;. There are 2 new features as far as I can see which are Genius playlist creation which came with iTunes 8 and a secure wipe of the phone in the event that the keypad lock is entered incorrectly too many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does the update live up to all of the promises listed above? Well, yes it does on this occasion! The whole experience of using the phone is back to how it was with version 1.1.4 in that it&amp;#x27;s fast, responsive, and doesn&amp;#x27;t crash every few minutes. I&amp;#x27;ll go over a few of the key improvements i&amp;#x27;ve seen from my own use over the last few days:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Application Installation / Crashes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regularly install and uninstall apps on to my iPhone as I love trying out the latest new things to come along. However, in the past it would take an absolute age to install anything on the phone - in fact I gave up doing it via the App Store on the iPhone itself as that usually didn&amp;#x27;t work (or would take an hour or so by which point the battery was dead) and so had resorted to sideloading apps via iTunes. This still could take a good 10 minutes or so though which wasn&amp;#x27;t really acceptable. Once the apps were on, they would frequently crash or hang - several times I had to do a hard reset of the phone (hold the home button and power button down together for about 10 seconds). Amusingly, I only learnt about the hard reset after the 3rd time my iPhone crashed (screen wouldn&amp;#x27;t come on) and I thought the only way to fix it was to do a restore via iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is all water under the bridge now as I managed to get 26 applications installed via iTunes in less than 5 minutes and have installed several apps via the App Store on the iPhone itself in a couple of minutes. A vast improvement! Additionally, I haven&amp;#x27;t had a single app crash on me yet which is also much improved on previous performance. Apps seem to be quitting correctly and quickly as well. For instance, in the past if I closed down &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284972147&amp;amp;mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Tap Tap Revenge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; by pressing the home button, the app would disappear and the home screen would appear but the music would keep playing for another 5-10 seconds or so. Now it just quits as it should have done in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Location Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#x27;t seen it reported widely but my location service was incredibly patchy. If I was in my house or at work, then pressing the &amp;quot;locate me&amp;quot; button would just lead to a little blue spinning circle which would never find me. I put this down to the iPhone 3G saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve got GPS - Use it even though it&amp;#x27;ll never work in this building&amp;quot; - there appeared to be no fallback to cell tower triangulation. This is fixed now though as within 2 seconds of pressing the button in my living room, I had been located to within 50m or so. GPS also seems to be a little faster outside but again it does a cell tower triangulation instantly before it even bothers with the GPS locater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it just needs a decent turn-by-turn GPS app to make it really good - I managed to fake this the other day whilst I was lost in Manchester by loading up Google Maps and making it do directions from my current location to my destination. This all showed up fine and then I literally scrolled across the map as the little GPS dot moved. This worked absolutely fine but I couldn&amp;#x27;t help but think it would have worked a whole lot better if when the blue dot got near the edge of the screen then the map scrolled automatically!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SMS Typing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By far the most annoying bug was that after a little bit of use, going to type an SMS message became painfully slow. The keyboard just had a huge amount of lag for no reason! I eventually found a fix for this which was to quit the SMS app, then open it again and delete a character - it would then go back to full speed. No need for this now though as I&amp;#x27;ve had no laggy text messages in the last few days!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;iTunes Backup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this is a fix in the firmware or for iTunes 8 I&amp;#x27;m not sure but the iPhone now backs up in about 10 seconds. I have seen the same iPhone (with less apps and music) take an hour and a half to backup before now so this really is very impressive! I had previously disabled my backups by using the following command in Terminal (make sure iTunes is turned off)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;defaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stops the iPhone doing a backup when it&amp;#x27;s connected to iTunes. However, I&amp;#x27;ve now amended this to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;defaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my backups are back up and running and are incredibly fast so I&amp;#x27;ll be leaving it on for the time being (although hopefully there won&amp;#x27;t be a need for a restore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a separate note, I&amp;#x27;m again not sure if this is an iPhone 2.1 update or an iTunes 8 update but when you are looking at your iPhone through iTunes, it actually shows how much space is used up by Apps rather than sticking them under the category of Other. Very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Passcode Locking / Secure Wipe&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about doing backups leads me nicely into a new feature of iPhone 2.1 - the ability to have your iPhone wipe itself if someone enters in the passcode incorrectly more than 10 times. This in response to the controversy surrounding Apple when it turned out that you could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2008/08/27/iphone-passcode-flaw-already-addressed-for-future-firmware-update/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;bypass the passcode&lt;/a&gt; if you had a certain setting enabled. Now most people commented that no-one used the passcode and I agreed with them as I had never had it enabled before. However, now there is a secure wipe option, I have put it back on so that if someone steals my phone I know my data is safe. If they enter the code in wrong more than 10 times then my iPhone will just wipe itself similar to the Exchange Remote Wipe feature. My only bug bear with the process is that 10 times is a long time. I&amp;#x27;d like to be able to change that number to 3 - I&amp;#x27;m not going to enter it in wrong that many times (and if I do then my fast backup process as detailed above means I can restore it fairly quickly). One &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=561173#post_message_6215873&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;commentator&lt;/a&gt; said they&amp;#x27;d like it changed so it wipes if you get it wrong the first time making each unlock a little like an episode of 24!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Genius Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#x27;t had much experience of this on my iPhone as I only have a small portion of my library loaded on to it, but it appears to work in the same way as genius within iTunes 8. The idea is that every time you sync, your library is sent up to the Apple Genius &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; where it is analysed and compared with other peoples libraries. it can then recommend you music in your library that goes with other music in your library leading to a nice playlist that blends together quite well. It&amp;#x27;s essentially the same as recommendations from last.fm but seems to work quite well. It should get better as more and more people use it as the cloud will have more data to analyse. The only improvement I can see to this (which is a long shot and won&amp;#x27;t ever happen) is if there was a way to get the tracks to mix into each other as you went between them in a playlist. I listen to a lot of dance music and it would be great if genius was clever enough to do a DJ style mix between them. There was an application on Dragons Den a few years ago that did that but I&amp;#x27;m not sure what happened to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the new firmware is a vast improvement and offers a few little extras as well such as secure wipe and Genius playlists. The other thing I&amp;#x27;ve noticed is that the icons for the different networks you are on (e.g. GPRS, Edge, 3G) have been changed slightly - Why I don&amp;#x27;t know but they do look a little clearer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#x27;t have it already, then upgrade to both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;iPhone 2.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;iTunes 8&lt;/a&gt; - you&amp;#x27;ll be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to control a Mac Mini from your iPhone including waking, sleeping, and audio / video</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/09/08/control-mac-mini-from-iphone-with-waking-sleeping-audio-video/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently cleaning through the &quot;technology cupboard&quot; in my flat (every geek has one - it&#39;s a place where all the useless electronics we&#39;ve collected over the years live) when I came across an idea for creating a home entertainment system for my bedroom.  The main driver for this was a forgotten Mac Mini (512MB of RAM and an old G4 processor) which I realised could hold all of my music on its 40GB hard drive and send it wirelessly to all of my other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that at present I have 3 computers at home and 1 at work (plus my iPhone 3G) which all have a complete copy of all of my music files (around 20GB - obviously the iPhone doesn&#39;t have all of that as it doesn&#39;t fit but that&#39;s a separate issue) - the downside to this is that when I update one machine the others are then out of sync.  My original plan was to have the mac mini hold everything and then the other computers would use it&#39;s hard drive over my network as the master copy.  That way if I added music to the mac mini, the others would all be in sync.  I have since completely given up on this idea as I needed to a) access music on my laptop all the time and b) access music on my work iMac without having to leave everything on at home and broadcast through a static IP (which would also have been a little slow especially when I skip through lots of tracks - I&#39;m very picky at what I listen to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since I started writing this article there have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=557826&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;rumours flying around&lt;/a&gt; about the 9th September &quot;Lets Rock&quot; event being staged by Apple.  Several sources are touting that iTunes 8 is going to be released and will have an option to stream your music wirelessly to other machines (or an iPhone) through the internet.  Let&#39;s hope this is true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the initial problem left alone for now, I decided to think on another problem I have.  If I want to listen to music in my bedroom, then I have to bring my laptop in and listen to it from there.  This isn&#39;t a huge difficulty but the sound quality isn&#39;t great and I don&#39;t like using my laptop in my bedroom (mainly because I try to keep some separation between work / computer based activities from other things I enjoy like reading and writing - the ideal separation is a physical one so I don&#39;t use my computer in my bedroom at all).  I could buy a cheap hi-fi system but then it wouldn&#39;t be connected to my iTunes library.  Alternatively I could get an iPhone dock but they are quite expensive (due to the magnetic shielding) and also I can&#39;t fit all my music on there so it wasn&#39;t really an option.  At this point I&#39;d like to point out that yes I could have used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/airportexpress/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;AirTunes&lt;/a&gt; (plugging a hi-fi unit into the 3mm audio jack on an Airport Express in order to pick up a shared iTunes library) but that would require me leaving the laptop on in the other room.  Not a great hardship but I&#39;d have to get out of bed to turn it off (which would be a hardship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of thought and a look at the components I had, I worked out that I could put the mac mini under my bed with a wireless card and some speakers and then play music through it using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284417350&amp;mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Apple Remote application&lt;/a&gt; available from the App Store for iPhone.  I could also install a VNC client so that I could control the mac mini remotely if necessary (in the case of copying music onto it, installing updates, etc).  Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m quite pedantic however and so the above solution wasn&#39;t yet 100% perfect.  The main problem I had was that the mac mini would need to be on 24 hours a day when I&#39;d only be using it for around an hour a day at most. This doesn&#39;t bother me from an environmental perspective (I&#39;m not into &quot;green&quot;) but did bother me from the point of view that I&#39;d be paying for electricity I wasn&#39;t using (around 45-50W an hour I believe which would be around 16p a day - that works out at nearly &amp;pound;60 a year for nothing!) and that the components would be wearing down from overuse.  It would probably become a little unstable as well and I&#39;d worry it would burst into flames or something!  So, the mac mini needed to be put to sleep and needed to be woken up.  I could do this by pressing the power button but it&#39;s under my bed and I can&#39;t be bothered with the movement involved.  Thus a solution had to be created that would let me wake it and put it to sleep remotely with my iPhone being the obvious candidate for this as it was already choosing the songs being played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Challenge One - Make the mac go to sleep remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up a machine is easy with Wake-on-LAN (as we&#39;ll see shortly) but there seems to be no easy way to put one to sleep.  My initial ideas of having an inactivity timer were quickly discarded as I realised that either the machine wouldn&#39;t go to sleep if music was left playing or it might go to sleep too quickly.  A better solution was needed and I eventually came across a terminal command which will make your mac sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;osascript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try the above in Terminal and watch in awe as your mac succumbs to tiredness.  So this is all well and good but can only be run on the machine which you want to put to sleep; it can&#39;t be done remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution to the problem comes in the form of the Apache2 web server that comes installed by default on all OS X Leopard installations.  If I could set the mac mini up as a server, knock up a bit of PHP to pass the sleep command directly to the machine, and then broadcast the IP so that the command could be run via Safari on the iPhone, then I would be on to a winner!  This is exactly what I ended up doing and the instructions are below for your delectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all we need to activate the Apache2 web server in Leopard.  To do this, go to &quot;System Preferences&quot; and then to the &quot;Sharing&quot; icon.  If you tick the &quot;Web Sharing&quot; checkbox, then the server will come to life and will be enabled whenever you start the machine.  You can check this has worked by going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt; on the machine and checking you get an apache default installation message.  Now this is done, we need to set our Computer Name for easy access to this page from anywhere on our home network.  The setting for this is also in the &quot;Sharing&quot; control panel and so I set mine to mini.  This allows the web server to be reached by any computer on the network by going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mini.local/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://mini.local/&lt;/a&gt; - try it yourself by changing it to whatever name you want (the URL to access your computer will be shown on the same screen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we can connect to the web server, we need to get PHP up and running and write our script.  PHP 5 doesn&#39;t come enabled by default so we have to do this by opening up terminal and typing the code below.  I am assuming at this point that you have the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; installed which is accessed from the &#39;mate&#39; command in Terminal.  If you don&#39;t have it, either install it or substitute &#39;mate&#39; for some other text editor command like &#39;pico&#39; or &#39;vi&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo mate /etc/apache2/httpd.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may need to type in your administrative password if prompted.  Now you have the Apache2 configuration file open, scroll down to somewhere around line 114 where you will find the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;# LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need to uncomment this (by removing the proceeding hash) and then save the file.  Once this is done, you&#39;ll need to restart Apache in order for your changes to be made available.  You do this with the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo apachectl graceful&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &#39;restart&#39; in place of &#39;graceful&#39; to do a full restart, but a graceful restart won&#39;t kick off anyone that is currently using your server.  This isn&#39;t going to matter here but it&#39;s a good habit to get into in case you ever need to restart an apache server in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have PHP5 installed and ready to go so lets write the PHP script that is going to power our sleep command.  You&#39;ll need to go to your Apache DocumentRoot (which by default is in a folder called Sites in your home folder) and delete any files that are in there.  Now create a new file called &quot;index.php&quot; with the following code in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &amp;quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;    &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;    &amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;quot;Content-type&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Mac Mini Sleeping App&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Goodnight...&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;./sleep.scpt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this code is doing is outputting a message that says &quot;goodnight&quot; and then executes an applescript file (in this case sleep.scpt) which contains the code from earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-applescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;osascript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;System Events&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it&#39;s easier to include a file in this way rather than typing the command into a function such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk3.php.net/passthru&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;passthru()&lt;/a&gt; as it allows for easier control over quotes, etc.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;exec()&lt;/a&gt; command used in the above is pretty much telling PHP to type the command we used earlier into Terminal.  Unfortunately this won&#39;t actually do anything at present (at least it shouldn&#39;t do) as the Apache webserver is not authorised by default to perform such important system commands as are available through exec().  To do this we need to go back to the Apache2 config file and set the user and group of the web server to be the same as that of the user of the machine.  Now this is a calculated security risk as it means any scripts on the server can have full access to your machine and thus compromise it.  However, this is for personal home use and no-one will be able to access it unless they are on your network let alone run scripts on it so I think it&#39;s ok.  Let&#39;s set the permissions by opening up the config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;sudo mate /etc/apache2/httpd.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go to around line 126 and amend the User to your own username and Group to &#39;staff&#39;.  In my case this was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;User ben
Group staff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours will differ (unless you&#39;re called ben) but you can find out what yours is by going to your home folder - the name of the folder is the name of your user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now restart the apache server (remember our graceful command from earlier?) and try out your site.  You should find that your mac goes fast to sleep.  Success!  Simply go to the URL with safari on your iPhone, tap the &#39;+&#39; icon, and then choose &quot;save to home screen&quot; in order to set it up as a web app.  If you want a fancy icon, then stick a square PNG named &quot;apple-touch-icon.png&quot; in the same folder as the index.php file and you&#39;ll notice that it appears on your home screen when you bookmark the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Challenge Two - Wake the mac up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, you now have a sleeping mac that you want to wake up.  Most computers have a little feature built in to them called Wake-on-LAN.  The idea is that when the computer is asleep, the ethernet port is actually still active and listening for data.  If a certain command is sent (referred to as a &quot;magic packet&quot;) then the ethernet card will tell the rest of the computer to wake up.  This is exactly what we need but unfortunately will not work over a wireless connection (as a wireless card doesn&#39;t stay awake when the computer is asleep).  If you have connected your mac to an ethernet connection then you can ignore the next few steps, but for me a long cable wasn&#39;t really an option.  I therefore came across a solution that would allow me to pretend I was on ethernet; wireless bridging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind wireless bridging is fairly simple.  Rather than having an ethernet cable from your router to your computer, you instead have 2 wireless routers that are connected via ethernet to each machine (or modem) which then act like an ethernet link between the two.  Now I already had an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/airportextreme/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Airport Extreme&lt;/a&gt; which was broadcasting my network / internet wirelessly and so all I needed was another router on the other end.  After a bit of headscratching with a BT router that was lying around, I decided the best way to proceed was to pop to the Apple Store and buy an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/airportexpress/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Airport Express&lt;/a&gt;.  The Airport Express is plugged into a standard power socket and then broadcasts a wireless signal.  On it&#39;s base it has 3 inputs; ethernet, USB, and 3mm Audio.  Usually the Airport Express is connected to a wired modem via ethernet so it can quickly and easily broadcast internet to the rest of your house however you can also plug in a printer to share that to wireless devices or plug in a standard hi-fi unit in order to utilise the AirTunes feature I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I instead used it&#39;s network bridging service in order to connect it to the mac mini via ethernet and then extend the wireless network created by my Airport Extreme.  This is fairly easy to do from the Airport Utility - I won&#39;t go into the exact process here as it is mimicked in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040927125820995&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;several other places&lt;/a&gt;, but the end result that the Airport Express connects to the wireless network created by the Airport Extreme and sends this to the mac mini via ethernet.  This means that we can now send a Wake-on-LAN command as both the Airport Extreme and Airport Express are &quot;always on&quot; allowing the packet to go through the bridge, down the ethernet cable, and straight into the ethernet port.  Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to find a way to send the magic packet from the iPhone.  The application &lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=286568674&amp;mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;iWOL&lt;/a&gt; allows us to do this easily and has a very quick setup.  Simply type in a name to reference the machine and the MAC address of the ethernet card (this can be found by going to &quot;System Preferences&quot;-&gt;&quot;Network&quot; and selecting your ethernet card.  Now click on &quot;advanced&quot; and then on the &quot;Ethernet&quot; tab.  Your MAC Address is the &quot;Ethernet ID&quot;).  Now enable &quot;LAN Broadcast&quot; mode and you should be good to go.  Once your computer is asleep, open up iWol and you should be able to wake it up at the press of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Further Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, my setup is working in the same way as detailed in the steps above.  I am in the process of making the sleeping web app slightly tidier with a fancy interface and icon, etc, and this will be available for download from my site shortly - the working title is &quot;Rohypnol&quot;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above steps, I have installed a freeware application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robbiehanson.com/alarmclock/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Alarm Clock 2&lt;/a&gt; on the mac mini which allows me to use it as an alarm clock.  Various options are available including a &quot;wake from sleep&quot; mode which is perfect for this project.  I now have a special playlist on my mac mini which starts off quietly and over 5 minutes gently increases in volume.  Nothing says wake up in the morning like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Rick Rollin&#39;&lt;/a&gt; music&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to control the mac mini better, I also installed a freeware VNC server called &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Vine Server&lt;/a&gt; that allows me to control the machine remotely. I won&#39;t go into the finer details of VNC setup as this has also been covered in detail &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xawk.com/apple-htpc-step01-setup-and-vnc.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;elsewhere on the net&lt;/a&gt;.  I will however mention the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284984448&amp;amp;mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;VNC Lite&lt;/a&gt; app for iPhone which allows you to access VNC controlled machines.  It&#39;s easy to use and very intuitive - it&#39;s also free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future I plan to make some improvements to this system by plugging in a monitor which can then sit on the end of the bed allowing me to watch movies and tv shows downloaded through iTunes as well as DVDs etc but this is an upgrade for another day.  For now I&#39;m quite happy with the setup which was achieved relatively easily and cheaply as I had all the components to hand.  I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend it if you were going to buy all the parts as the whole system would cost about &amp;pound;500 but as a small project it&#39;s worked very well.  Now I just have to wait to see what iTunes 8 will add to this setup&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the biggest web app of 2007 was &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the simple web app that allowed you to send a text message and have that sent for free to anyone that followed you.  Combined with a simple API, useful web apps could be created to send you txts when your train was going to be delayed or when you got a new email, etc.  However, this has all stopped in the UK, Europe, and Australia for the time being as Twitter has finally turned off the ability to send messages (although you can still update your status by sending a txt).  The full details are below in an email that was received by those registered with the service in affected areas and also on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.twitter.com/2008/08/changes-for-some-sms-usersgood-and-bad.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;twitter blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sending you this note because you registered a mobile device to work with Twitter over our UK number. I wanted to let you know that we are making some changes to the way SMS works on Twitter. There is some good news and some bad news.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start with the bad news. Beginning today, Twitter is no longer delivering outbound SMS over our UK number. If you enjoy receiving updates from Twitter via +44 762 480 1423, we are recommending that you explore some suggested alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You will still be able to UPDATE over our UK number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into more detail, here&#39;s a bit of good news: Twitter will be introducing several new, local SMS numbers in countries throughout Europe in the coming weeks and months. These new numbers will make Twittering more accessible for you if you&#39;ve been using SMS to send long-distance updates from outside the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we making these changes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates. When you send one message to Twitter and we send it to ten followers, you aren&#39;t charged ten times--that&#39;s because we&#39;ve been footing the bill. When we launched our free SMS service to the world, we set the clock ticking. As the service grew in popularity, so too would the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our challenge during this window of time was to establish relationships with mobile operators around the world such that our SMS services could become sustainable from a cost perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We achieved this goal in Canada, India, and the United States. We can provide full incoming and outgoing SMS service without passing along operator fees in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but we&#39;ve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach. Since you probably don&#39;t live in Canada, India, or the US, we recommend receiving your Twitter
updates via one of the following methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.twitter.com&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;m.twitter.com&lt;/a&gt; works on browser-enabled phones&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter SMS by The Numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pains us to take this measure. However, we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service. Even with a limit of 250 messages received per week, it could cost Twitter about $1,000 per user, per year to send SMS outside of Canada, India, or the US. It makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter will continue to negotiate with mobile operators in Europe, Asia, China, and The Americas to forge relationships that benefit all our users. Our goal is to provide full, two-way service with Twitter via SMS to every nation in a way that is sustainable from a cost perspective. Talks with mobile companies around the world continue. In the meantime, more local numbers for updating via SMS are on the way. We&#39;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention,&lt;br /&gt;
Biz Stone, Co-founder&lt;br /&gt;
Twitter, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/biz&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/biz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this has upset a LOT of users (especially in Australia) but is the general outcry from the web community really justified?  As Twitter themselves say, it could cost them nearly $1000 per user per year to send txts and with 2.2 million users that ain&#39;t cheap.  It has always been a mystery to me as to how Twitter makes money and how they are able to send all these txts for free so it comes as no surprise that they have finally stopped doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the alternatives?  I&#39;m using a mac and an iPhone so I&#39;ve gone for the obvious choice of &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Twitteriffic&lt;/a&gt; on both which does a pretty good job.  On my mac, I get a little chirpy noise and a popup when I get a tweet which works a lot better than an SMS in a lot of ways and this is similar on the iPhone.  The only downside is that the iPhone doesn&#39;t support 3rd party apps running in the background so at present you have to open the app to see if there are any updates which is a bit of a pain.  However, this is due to change with iPhone Firmware 2.1 which is hopefully going to be with us some time in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ability to receive twitters from Twitteriffic seamlessly occurs, I think it will prove a lot more successful than the txt message route.  Firstly, because it will cost nothing to reply (whereas previously it was very easy to reply to a twitter from a txt and thus get charged for it) and secondly because new features can be added to the service.  Twitteriffic already supports location awareness on the iPhone so people can see where I am twittering from - a small improvement but an improvement none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to everybody shouting at Twitter about this issue, why don&#39;t they instead complain about the mobile phone companies who are so greedy in the affected countries that they refuse to do a deal with Twitter?  It comes as no surprise to me that in the UK the cellular networks refused to budge on pricing but that is no fault of Twitter who have been paying so much over the last year and a half to make a great service at absolutely no cost to the end user (not even adding advertising to tweets which would seem an obvious money making route).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in answer to &lt;em&gt;&quot;is Twitter now dead&quot;&lt;/em&gt; I would say no!  There are still several uses for it (e.g. I use it to keep a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog&quot;&gt;micro blog on my homepage&lt;/a&gt;) and with several applications for all types of phones it is still easy to stay updated.  It will become really useful for me however when Apple release the next iPhone update with push technology - then it will be as if nothing had even changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Amusingly it looks like someone is already trying to cash in on the lack of SMS from Twitter around most of the world.  Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tweetSMS.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;tweetSMS&lt;/a&gt; will &quot;send you individual, hourly or daily updates from all (or just some) of your friends&quot; for a &quot;very small fee&quot;.  We&#39;ll see how small that fee is when they launch I suppose&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kampyle - An easy way to get web user feedback</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kampyle.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Kampyle&lt;/a&gt; is an easy to set-up javascript widget that gives users the opportunity to comment on your site either for the purposes of a bug report or simply to say &quot;you have a nice site&quot;.  On clicking the feedback icon, a new window opens that gives the user various different options on how to comment on the site.  The default options are Bug, Site Content, Suggestion, Compliment, and Other. Each of these has several sub-options such as &quot;browser issues&quot; or &quot;feature request&quot; which are all completely customisable by the website owner.  The user can then fill in a bit of text to describe the problem or suggestion, etc, and can choose from 5 different emoticons to say how they feel about the website in general.  All of this information is then logged in your account at the Kampyle website for you to look over at your leisure - they can also email daily reports to you so that you can stay on top of all your adoring fans or pissed off IE6 users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve installed Kampyle on my site (using a custom icon as their default choices are pretty bad - animated gif anyone?) and I&#39;ve already had quite a few pieces of feedback.  The great thing is that I&#39;ve been able to fix a few bugs people have alerted me to and then have Kampyle email them back to let them know that the issue has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kampyle is pretty good as it is, but the thing that is putting Kampyle on the map is their recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kampyle.com/blog/?p=53&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;integration with Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; which means you can see all of your feedback stats within your Google Analytics account.  The way they have done this is particularly clever - You need to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Grease Monkey Firefox Extension&lt;/a&gt; and install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kampyle.com/zlib_off/kampyle.user.js&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Kampyle Grease Monkey script&lt;/a&gt;, but then when you go to your Google Analytics account you&#39;ll see the Kampyle stats showing up in their own dashboard widgets.  Pretty clever really.  This was a major incentive for me as it means I can now see all of my stats in one place rather than having multiple accounts across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you&#39;d like to leave any feedback on the site just click on the &quot;Leave Feedback&quot; banner in the bottom right hand corner!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop! Bug found in "Stop! Hammertime!" Firefox Extension on Windows XP / Vista</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/stop-bug-found-in-stop-hammertime-firefox-extension-on-windows-xp-vista/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/stop-bug-found-in-stop-hammertime-firefox-extension-on-windows-xp-vista/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a few reports from people saying that the latest version of the Stop! Hammertime! firefox extension hasn&#39;t been working properly on Windows XP and Windows Vista.  A new version will be coming soon but here is a fix for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem that people are reporting is that when you go to the preferences section for the extension and try to change the stop button to the custom hammertime button, it won&#39;t let you press the &quot;ok&quot; button to proceed with the change.  It is currently only affecting Firefox 3 on Windows XP and Windows Vista but I&#39;ll be making a patch to fix it shortly.  For the time being, if you can&#39;t live without a hammertime button (despite the fact the stop button still works and plays the sound), then you can follow the steps below to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you need to type &quot;about:config&quot; in the address bar of the browser.  This allows you access some of the internal preferences and config settings of firefox and all of your installed extensions.  You will most likely get a &quot;here be dragons&quot; warning but you can skip this - you do know what you&#39;re doing right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will then need to use the filter option to locate the Stop! Hammertime! preferences.  You can do this by typing &quot;hammertime&quot; in the filter box - this should give you one result which by default is set to &quot;false&quot;.  You need to double click to change it to &quot;true&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve done this, simply restart firefox and the new hammertime button will be there for you to enjoy!  To change it back to the stop button, simply follow the steps above but make sure the hammertime config entry is set to &quot;false&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An update will hopefully be available in the next fews days so that you won&#39;t have to perform the above to switch between the two, but this should do for the time being.  Alternatively you can buy an Apple Mac or install Linux!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other Stop! Hammertime! news, it seems that the copyright holders for the song &quot;U Can&#39;t Touch This&quot; have noticed it&#39;s popularity and are attempting to cash in on it.  I recently had an email from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icgcopyright.com/icg/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Integrated Copyright Group (ICG)&lt;/a&gt; informing me that I&#39;d need to purchase a license in order to play the 2 second sound clip in the firefox extension otherwise I would be in breach of copyright.  After a few back and forths we came to the conclusion that they could send a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter from their lawyers but that the extension wasn&#39;t being removed (and I wasn&#39;t paying for a license).  So, we&#39;ll see what happens - expect updates on this shortly!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone 3G, Apps, MobileMe, and iPhone specific sites</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/iphone3g-apps-mobileme-and-iphone-specific-sites/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/iphone3g-apps-mobileme-and-iphone-specific-sites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&#39;ve probably heard of the iPhone (unless you&#39;ve been living under a rock in Redmond) - Apple&#39;s debut outing into the mobile phone arena, and what a debut it has been!  The interface is easy to use, the build quality is good, and it has a number of interesting features (e.g. visual voicemail) which make up for it&#39;s huge lacking of the most basic features (e.g. MMS).  I&#39;ve been using one for the past 3 months but have just recently upgraded to the iPhone 3G after &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/bendodson/2665427230/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;queueing for a couple of hours outside the Fleet Street branch of O2&lt;/a&gt; on launch day.  But what are the new features and have they really improved the &quot;jesus phone&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the most talked about features that have been added are 3G support (which allows for faster data transfer) and GPS (pin-point location service).  The difference in speed between 3G and Edge is not that noticeable on most websites I&#39;ve found, but when using applications like maps or mail it is an absolute godsend.  Having said that, although pages take about the same amount of time to load, they seem to render a lot quicker (e.g. the screen stays white for a long period of time before suddenly filling up with content incredibly quickly).  GPS was the main thing I was looking forward to and it seems to be a bit hit and miss.  Sometimes I can enable it and it will have my exact location within about 4 seconds whereas other times it just never gets a lock.  What makes this so annoying is that it doesn&#39;t seem to use cell tower triangulation or wireless networks to get a rough approximation of my location as the old iPhone did. It just keeps hoping it will see a GPS satellite.  I had been hoping that there would be an app that would automatically send my current location to a service such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Fire Eagle&lt;/a&gt; at regular intervals so that I could make some cool location mashups but with the current support it seems unlikely that it would work. Oh, and these 2 features drain the battery like you would not believe!  Fortunately I don&#39;t move too far outdoors so I&#39;m always near a healthy electric supply!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other differences between the iPhone and the iPhone 3G are very small but have actually meant more to me so far than 3G or GPS.  The first is that the back is no longer metal but plastic.  At first I thought this would be absolutely terrible but it actually makes the phone feel a lot more comfortable.  Also, all of the buttons (such as the silent switch and power button) are all brushed metal so they feel a lot more reliable and well built.  The other big improvement is that the sound quality is much improved on both the internal and external speaker.  I can actually use the loudspeaker now whereas before it just sounded like a normal phone with the volume turned up a bit (very muffled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main enhancement has definitely been the introduction of iPhone 2.0, the much anticipated software upgrade available to both the old iPhone and the iPod Touch.  With the software you can now have Exchange mail, contact searching, and run 3rd party applications on the device.  It is this that seems to have become the main reason people want an iPhone 3G although to be honest I probably could have kept the old iPhone that I paid a ridiculous sum of money for only 3-4 months ago!  I have several apps installed now including services for Twitter, Flickr, Last.fm, and Facebook, a VNC client, a lightsabre, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tapulous.com/taptap/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Guitar Hero style tapping game&lt;/a&gt;, Super Monkey Ball, and a mobile version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://culturedcode.com/things/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt; (which doesn&#39;t sync yet but &lt;a href=&quot;http://culturedcode.com/things/forums/read.php?6,4239&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;they promised a free upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that will).  I&#39;ll be posting some updates over the coming days about various exciting apps that have arrived or are hopefully coming soon.  At the moment there is a real gap for an MSN Messenger client as I haven&#39;t found one yet but they seem to be adding 10-20 apps per day so there should be one in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting development which Apple have introduced is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/mobileme/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;MobileMe&lt;/a&gt; which is supposedly &quot;Exchange for the rest of us&quot;.  It also has some of the best functioning &quot;Web 2.0&quot; apps that I have ever seen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.me.com&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;me.com&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is that all of your email, contacts, and calendar entries are stored online in a &quot;cloud&quot; and are then automatically pushed to your phone and computers.  Now this seemed great for me as I&#39;m always updating things on the phone and then either having to plug it into my mac or update it on there manually.  I have both a MacBook and an iMac so it becomes a hassle trying to sync them all so it seemed like a very good idea.  Unfortunately the launch has been marred by huge problems over the launch weekend (e.g. it didn&#39;t work), some pissed off customers who didn&#39;t agree with Apple&#39;s marketing of the push system (e.g. showing a MacBook making a change that replicates instantly on the &quot;cloud&quot; but in reality it&#39;s a 15 minute automated sync rather than the push capability used by the phone), and also with a small error in which they took &amp;pound;121 off your credit card instead of $1 to authorise the payments.  However, all of this aside, MobileMe is absolutely great!  I add items to my calendar on my mac and they then show up on my iPhone.  I take a picture of someone on my iPhone and add it to their section in my address book and sure enough the photo is displayed on my MacBook the next time they email me.  It all works incredibly well but then it should do for &amp;pound;59 per year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final thoughts on the whole iPhone thing revolve around iPhone specific sites.  That is to say taking a normal website (e.g. facebook) and then having it detect if you are using an iPhone or not and then displaying specific content or styling for that device.  Now normally I would be against such practices (remember IE4?) but in this case I have to say &quot;why not&quot;?  The iPhone has completely redefined mobile internet (in my opinion and doubtless many others) and has a unique interface and styling that are begging to be exploited.  The Facebook site is probably the best example for the way in which it seamlessly detects the iPhone and then displays a site that has been completely optimised for it (and styled to make it look like a native app).  Now that there is the opportunity to run apps natively on the iPhone I&#39;m sure a number of these sites will disappear but for those of us that can&#39;t write objective-C (and I can&#39;t say I have a great desire to start learning it) then it is the closest way we can get to writing apps for the iPhone.  I am going to be making some sites specifically for the iPhone as well as some of my own personal systems which I&#39;ll be able to now access remotely and do some cool stuff with.  This debate is currently waging on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webstandardsgroup.org/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Web Standards Group&lt;/a&gt; Mailing List so I&#39;d urge anyone with an opinion to sign up and discuss it there.  Alternatively you can put your thoughts on this issue here by using the comment box below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does anybody really use RSS Feeds?</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/does-anybody-really-use-rss-feeds/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <author>ben@bendodson.com (Ben Dodson)</author>
      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/21/does-anybody-really-use-rss-feeds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using RSS feeds for several years now and find them incredibly useful for keeping up to date with blogs and news sites.  However, today I was talking to another web developer who said that he hates RSS feeds and would much rather have email updates when a site gets updated rather than having to add an RSS feed to his email client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I wouldn&#39;t find this strange coming from a lot of people as I can understand that a lot of people have no idea about RSS and would get confused trying to work out what an aggregator is.  But from a web developer?  Come on!  If the people that develop websites with RSS can&#39;t even be bothered to use it then what chance is there of the general populous using it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use mac mail to manage all of my RSS feeds and find that it does a fairly good job - everything gets synced over to my iPhone as well so I can keep up to date when I&#39;m on the train etc.  I also have a few RSS feeds on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/ig&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;iGoogle homepage&lt;/a&gt; so I can see the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dilbert.com/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;dilbert&lt;/a&gt; strip whilst I&#39;m pretending to work.  Now I&#39;m fairly sure you can set Outlook up to receive RSS feeds - so why doesn&#39;t this developer do that?  Apparently, if Windows were to crash (unlikely but stay with me on this) then he would lose all of the RSS feeds he was tracking and therefore have to add them again so it&#39;s not worth doing.  &quot;You could use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/help/reader/tour.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; or any other number of online aggregators&quot; say I.  &quot;Too much effort&quot; says he.  I give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the next day or so there will be a &quot;sign up&quot; button on this site so that those of you who can&#39;t be bothered with RSS can get email alerts when a new message is posted.  I&#39;ve also set up a twitter account which will be syndicating the posts on this site as and when they happen - the account to follow is &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bendodson_com/&quot; title=&quot;Stay up to date with bendodson.com/weblog on Twitter&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;bendodson_com&lt;/a&gt;.  Oh, and for those of you that have moved into the 21st century, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/rss.xml&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;good old RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Website upgrades finally completed</title>
      <link>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/19/website-upgrades-finally-completed/</link>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/07/19/website-upgrades-finally-completed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the more regular visitors amongst you may have noticed that for the past month or so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot; title=&quot;PHP Developer Ben Dodson&quot;&gt;bendodson.com/weblog&lt;/a&gt; has been in a mild state of flux - I&#39;m happy to say that everything is now completed and working fully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hurried the uploading of the new design as I had some spare time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/bendodson/sets/72157605753188176/&quot; title=&quot;Mashed 08 at Alexandra Palace&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Mashed&lt;/a&gt; and thought it would be a good idea to get the new site up and running in any state.  Then, the knowledge that my site might not be working would spur me on to fixing it.  A good theory, but apparently not good in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several bugs in IE6 (there always are), the site was taking too long to load, and the contact form didn&#39;t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, the site has been optimised to a grade A level (according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;YSlow&lt;/a&gt;), the IE6 bugs have been fixed, and email now works from my server so the contact form is working again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be continuing to make little tweaks and upgrades here and there, but I&#39;ll also be returning to the blogging scene and keeping the site regularly updated with various development news.  As a taster, I have recently been playing with a new iPhone 3G, fire eagle, a montage making script that uses flickr, and Google Optimizer (although not all at the same time) so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New website goes live!</title>

      <guid>https://bendodson.com/weblog/2008/06/21/new-website-goes-live/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve finally got around to giving the site a visual refresh which can now be viewed here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;bendodson.com/weblog&lt;/a&gt; - There are a few bugs (mainly IE6) to iron out but on the whole it should be working!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site was redesigned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://lizahayes.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Liza Hayes&lt;/a&gt; who took her inspiration mainly from Doctor Who!  I&#39;ve been building it slowly over the past few months, but I&#39;m currently at &lt;a href=&quot;http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/472718&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Mashed&lt;/a&gt; so decided whilst I had the time dedicated to coding I really should get on and finish it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be various updates to the site over the next few days so keep posted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that this page is now outdated - for any updates to the London Underground, you should use my dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot;&gt;Tube Status API and RSS feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been spending some time making an RSS feed of the London Underground tube status as I&#39;ve been working on a few projects that could use one.  You would think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Transport for Londons&lt;/a&gt; nice web 2.0 style website would provide this basic requirement but alas they don&#39;t.  There are a few developers out there who have written some scraping scripts to convert this information, but most of them no longer work as they haven&#39;t been updated to work with the new site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I have used the script at &lt;a href=&quot;http://conor.net/code/tube/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;conor.net&lt;/a&gt; to power any projects requiring a tube RSS feed but this went down a few weeks ago when I was in the middle of some crucial testing. So, like any other crazy developer would, I decided to write my own PHP scraping script that would generate me a nice RSS feed to basically tell me TFL had messed up my journey home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you just looking for an RSS feed of the London Underground tube delays, you can find it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/rss/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://tubeupdates.com/rss/&lt;/a&gt; - This is automatically updated every minute and will email me if anything goes wrong so I can fix it!  If you are going to use it for any projects, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/contact/&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; so that I can monitor bandwidth, etc.  If you are interested in how it works, then the code that powers this is below - feel free to use and modify it for your own projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This file should be run on a CRON job every 5 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The server will need to be able to write to this folder in order to create the XML file.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I am working on a few projects that utilise this script and I shall be making those available shortly.  However, for a sneak peek, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/08/19/retiring-tubeupdates-and-wikilocation/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Tube Updates&lt;/a&gt;, an API for any developer that would like to make use of this data.  There are still a few improvements to be made but you get the general idea!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent some time updating my firefox extensions so that all of them work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Firefox 3 Beta 3&lt;/a&gt;. At present they can only be downloaded from this site as it takes the Mozilla Addons team a few days to approve updates.  My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/extensions/&quot;&gt;extensions page&lt;/a&gt; is now back up and running though and contains details on all 3 of my Firefox Extensions (Font Finder, Stop! Hammertime!, and STOP in the name of love) as well as download links for the new releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t be making any further updates to the stop buttons (apart from making them work with future version of Firefox) but I will be continuing development on Font Finder which could benefit from a visual overhaul as well as a clipboard function!  I&#39;ll be updating on here when it happens so sign up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for the latest news!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google extended encoding made easy!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been having a play around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/chart&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Google Charts&lt;/a&gt; recently but came across a problem with the range of values that can be used. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/chart/#simple&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;simple encoding&lt;/a&gt;, you can only have values between 0 and 64, and with &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/chart/#text&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;text encoding&lt;/a&gt; only values between 0 to 100.  This is annoying when dealing with things such as tracking website hits or weight when values are typically much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played around with some functions to try and factorise the numbers so that they would be in the range of 0 to 100 but this didn&#39;t go so well so I decided to tackle Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/chart/#extended&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;extended encoding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a system of encoding that basically takes a pair of alphanumeric characters and translates them into a number between 0 and 4095 (much better!).  So for example, B9 translates to 125 and .a would translate to 4058.  However, although this has a much larger range, it&#39;s a bit harder to get your head around and so what is needed is a simple function (or two) to convert to and from the extended encoding.  Predictably, I have said PHP functions here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;array_to_extended_encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$characters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$characters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$characters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They work fairly simply by taking advantage of PHP&#39;s casting methods in that a string can be interpreted as an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first function, &lt;code&gt;array_to_extended_encoding()&lt;/code&gt;, an array of numbers should be passed e.g. &lt;code&gt;array(250,39,400,1904,2)&lt;/code&gt;.  The function first lists all of the extended encoding characters in order as one string named &lt;code&gt;$characters&lt;/code&gt;.  It then loops through our array of numbers, and creates two variables; &lt;code&gt;$first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$second&lt;/code&gt;.  In &lt;code&gt;$first&lt;/code&gt;, we store the number from our array divided by 64 and rounded down using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php.net/floor&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;floor()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function.  For &lt;code&gt;$second&lt;/code&gt;, we use the modulus operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) to find the remainder once the number from the array is divided by 64.  We then take both &lt;code&gt;$first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$second&lt;/code&gt; and work out the encoding by looking up the numbers from within the &lt;code&gt;$characters&lt;/code&gt; cast as an array.  This gives us 2 characters which make up the extended encoding for the number.  We keep extending the value of &lt;code&gt;$encoding&lt;/code&gt; until we end up with a string representing the full extended encoding of the array passed to the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second function, &lt;code&gt;extended_encoding_to_array()&lt;/code&gt;, is slightly more advanced.  It accepts a string as its only parameter which should be an extended encoding (e.g. &lt;code&gt;$encoding = &#39;AA..B9aC&#39;&lt;/code&gt;).  We first list all of the characters in a string as we did for our previous function, but then we create two arrays which will contain all of the numbers we need to decode the extended encoding.  In &lt;code&gt;$first&lt;/code&gt;, we create an array of each character in the &lt;code&gt;$characters&lt;/code&gt; string as a number multiplied by 64 (so the letter b would be 64 as it is signified by number 1 in the array multiplied by 64).  Within &lt;code&gt;$second&lt;/code&gt; we perform a similar operation but instead just assign the number of the character rather than multiplying it by 64.  This gives us two arrays, with keys relating to each character that can be used as an encoding and values as the numerical equivalent.  It is now a simple case of splitting the string that was passed to the function into chunks of 2 characters using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php.net/str_split&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str_split()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and looping through the returned array setting the value of each character within the pair from the arrays we created.  We then add the two returned numbers together to give us the decoded figure and add it to an array which will be returned by the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple?  It has certainly made things a lot easier for the functions I&#39;m writing for a PHP wrapper for Google Charts and hopefully it will help somebody else as well.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may have noticed, the new site design has caused the Firefox Extensions page to go awry.  This will return shortly (along with a few new extensions) but for the time being you are better to go the Mozilla Addons site to download the extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stop! Hammertime&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/974&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/974&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Font Finder&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4415&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4415&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stop in the Name of Love&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3771&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3771&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt; The extensions page is now up and running again and can be viewed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bendodson.com/weblog/extensions/&quot;&gt;https://bendodson.com/weblog/extensions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve finally got around to adding full multi-user support for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.bendodson.com/weblog/phpmyopenid/&quot;&gt;phpMyOpenID&lt;/a&gt; script and I&#39;m now looking for some beta testers to help find any bugs that are lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;
